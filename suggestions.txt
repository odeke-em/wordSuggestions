chapter one the eve of the war no one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man s and yet as mortal as his own that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised { 	
crustiness:-1 industries:0 scrutineer:-1 scrutinies:6 scrutinise:8 scrutinize:4 scrutinous:-1 securities:-1 securitise:0 sinecurist:1 sturdiness:-1 }

and studied perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water with infinite complacency { 	
complacent:4 compliance:0 compliancy:0 complicacy:1 complicant:-1 }

men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs serene in their assurance of their empire over matter it is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same no one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable it is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days at most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon mars perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise yet across the gulf of space minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic {

regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us and early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment the planet mars i scarcely need remind the reader revolves about the sun at a mean distance of miles and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world it must be if the nebular hypothesis has any truth older than our world and long before this earth ceased to be molten life upon its surface must have begun its course the fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated {

at which life could begin it has air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence yet so vain is man and so blinded by his vanity that no writer up to the very end of the nineteenth century expressed any idea that intelligent {

life might have developed there far or indeed at all beyond its earthly level nor was it generally understood that since mars is older than our earth with scarcely a quarter of the superficial area and remoter from the sun it necessarily { 	
necessary:4 necessity:-1 }

follows that it is not only more distant from time s beginning but nearer its end the secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already gone far indeed with our neighbour its physical condition is still largely a mystery but we know now that even in its equatorial region the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter its air is much more attenuated than ours its oceans have shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface and as its slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically {

of mars the immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects enlarged their powers and hardened their hearts and looking across space with instruments {

and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of they see at its nearest distance only of miles sunward of them a morning star of hope our own warmer planet green with vegetation and grey with water with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow navy crowded seas and we men the creatures who inhabit this earth must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us the intellectual { 	
intellect:3 intellects:2 }

side of man already admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon mars their world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals to carry warfare sunward is indeed their only escape from the destruction {

that generation after generation creeps upon them and before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought not only upon animals such as the vanished bison and the dodo but upon its inferior races the tasmanians {

immigrants in the space of fifty years are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the martians warred in the same spirit the martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing subtlety their mathematical {

gas upon the planet it had occurred towards midnight of the twelfth and the spectroscope {

to which he had at once resorted indicated a mass of flaming gas chiefly hydrogen moving with an enormous velocity towards this earth this jet of fire had become invisible about a quarter past twelve he compared it to a colossal puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet as flaming gases rushed out of a gun a singularly appropriate { 	
apparitor:-1 }

phrase it proved yet the next day there was nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the daily telegraph and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest dangers that ever threatened the human race i might not have heard of the eruption at all had i not met ogilvy { 	
ogival:0 overlying:-1 }

the well known astronomer at ottershaw { 	
othergates:0 others:-1 ottars:-1 otters:0 }

he was immensely excited at the news and in the excess of his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a scrutiny of the red planet in spite of all that has happened since i still remember that vigil very distinctly the black and silent observatory the shadowed lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner the steady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope the little slit in the roof an oblong profundity with the stardust {

streaked across it ogilvy moved about invisible but audible looking through the telescope one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round but so little it was so silvery warm a pin s head of light it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating with the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to advance and recede but that was simply that my eye was tired forty millions of miles it was from us more than forty millions of miles of void few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swims near it in the field i remember were three faint points of light three telescopic stars infinitely remote and all around it was the unfathomable { 	
unfathomed:1 }

darkness of empty space you know how that blackness looks on a frosty starlight night in a telescope it seems far profounder and invisible to me because it was so remote and small flying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible distance drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles came the thing they were sending us the thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity and death to the earth i never dreamed of it then as i watched no one on earth dreamed of that unerring missile that night too there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet i saw it a reddish flash at the edge the slightest projection of the outline just as the chronometer { 	
chromogen:-1 chromomere:2 }

struck midnight and at that i told ogilvy and he took my place the night was warm and i was thirsty and i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the darkness to the little table where the siphon stood while ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us that night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth from mars just a second or so under twenty four hours after the first one i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes i wished i had a light to smoke by little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam i had seen and all that it would presently bring me ogilvy watched till one and then gave it up and we lit the lantern and walked over to his house down below in the darkness were ottershaw and chertsey {

that night about the condition of mars and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were signalling us his idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy shower upon the planet or that a huge volcanic explosion was in progress he pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets the chances against anything manlike on mars are a million to one he said hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after about midnight and again the night after and so for ten nights a flame each night why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth has attempted to explain it may be the gases of the firing caused the martians inconvenience dense clouds of smoke or dust visible through a powerful telescope on earth as little grey fluctuating patches spread through the clearness of the planet s atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances { 	
disburdens:-1 dispersant:-1 disturbant:2 disturbers:0 disturbs:-1 }

at last and popular notes appeared here there and everywhere concerning the volcanoes upon mars the seriocomic periodical punch i remember made a happy use of it in the political cartoon and all unsuspected { 	
unsceptred:-1 unsuspect:5 }

those missiles the martians had fired at us drew earthward rushing now at a pace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space hour by hour and day by day nearer and nearer it seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that with that swift fate hanging over us men could go about their petty concerns as they did i remember how jubilant markham {

passed us singing and playing music there were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the people went to bed from the railway station in the distance came the sound of shunting trains ringing and rumbling softened almost into melody by the distance my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the sky it seemed so safe and tranquil chapter two the falling star then came the night of the first falling star it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester {

rose early with the idea of finding it find it he did soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits an enormous hole had been made by the impact of the projectile and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction over the heath forming heaps visible a mile and a half away the heather was on fire eastward and a thin blue smoke rose against the dawn the thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand amidst the scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its descent the uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun coloured incrustation { 	
incautions:0 inconstant:-1 incrusting:0 insouciant:0 intrusion:-1 }

it had a diameter of about thirty yards he approached the mass surprised at the size and more so at the shape since most meteorites are rounded more or less completely it was however still so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near approach a stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling of its surface for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow he remained standing at the edge of the pit that the thing had made for itself staring at its strange appearance astonished chiefly at its unusual shape and colour and dimly perceiving even then some evidence of design in its arrival the early morning was wonderfully { 	
wonderful:5 }

still and the sun just clearing the pine trees towards weybridge was already warm he did not remember hearing any birds that morning there was certainly no breeze stirring and the only sounds were the faint movements from within the cindery cylinder he was all alone on the common then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite was falling off the circular edge of the end it was dropping off in flakes and raining down upon the sand a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth for a minute he scarcely realised what this meant and although the heat was excessive he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to see the thing more clearly he fancied even then that the cooling of the body might account for this but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder and then he perceived that very slowly the circular top of the cylinder was rotating on its body it was such a gradual movement that he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the circumference even then he scarcely understood what this indicated until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so then the thing came upon him in a flash the cylinder was artificial hollow with an end that screwed out something within the cylinder was unscrewing the top good heavens said ogilvy there s a man in it men in it half roasted to death trying to escape at once with a quick mental leap he linked the thing with the flash upon mars the thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn but luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands on the still glowing metal at that he stood irresolute for a moment then turned scrambled out of the pit and set off running wildly into woking the time then must have been somewhere about six o clock he met a waggoner and tried to make him understand but the tale he told and his appearance were so wild his hat had fallen off in the pit that the man simply drove on he was equally unsuccessful {

and promises and went off back to the town again to get help one can imagine them covered with sand excited and disordered running up the little street in the bright sunlight just as the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows henderson went into the railway station at once in order to telegraph the news to london the newspaper articles had prepared men s minds for the reception of the idea by eight o clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already started for the common to see the dead men from mars that was the form the story took i heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a quarter to nine when i went out to get my daily chronicle i was naturally startled and lost no time in going out and across the ottershaw bridge to the sand pits chapter three on horsell common i found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding {

the huge hole in which the cylinder lay i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk embedded in the ground the turf and gravel about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion no doubt its impact had caused a flash of fire henderson and ogilvy were not there i think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present and had gone away to breakfast at henderson s house there were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the pit with their feet dangling and amusing themselves until i stopped them by throwing stones at the giant mass after i had spoken to them about it they began playing at touch in and out of the group of bystanders among these were a couple of cyclists a jobbing gardener i employed sometimes a girl carrying a baby gregg {

at this inanimate bulk some went away while i was there and other people came i clambered into the pit and fancied i heard a faint movement under my feet the top had certainly ceased to rotate it was only when i got thus close to it that the strangeness {

of this object was at all evident to me at the first glance it was really no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road not so much so indeed it looked like a rusty gas float it required a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the grey scale of the thing was no common oxide that the yellowish white metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder had an unfamiliar hue extra terrestrial had no meaning for most of the onlookers at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars but i judged it improbable that it contained any living creature i thought the unscrewing might be automatic in spite of ogilvy i still believed that there were men in mars my mind ran fancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript on the difficulties {

that might arise whether we should find coins and models in it and so forth yet it was a little too large for assurance on this idea i felt an impatience to see it opened about eleven as nothing seemed happening i walked back full of such thought to my home in maybury {

but i found it difficult to get to work upon my abstract investigations in the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very much the early editions of the evening papers had startled london with enormous headlines a message received from mars remarkable story from woking and so forth in addition ogilvy s wire to the astronomical exchange had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms there were half a dozen flies or more from the woking station standing in the road by the sand pits a basket chaise from chobham {

and a rather lordly carriage besides that there was quite a heap of bicycles in addition a large number of people must have walked in spite of the heat of the day from woking and chertsey so that there was altogether quite a considerable {

and something seemed to have irritated him a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered though its lower end was still embedded as soon as ogilvy saw me among the staring crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down and asked me if i would mind going over to see lord hilton {

i am i went on to the crowd there were really i should think two or three hundred people elbowing and jostling one another the one or two ladies there being by no means the least active he s fallen in the pit cried some one keep back said several the crowd swayed a little and i elbowed my way through every one seemed greatly excited i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit i say said ogilvy help keep these idiots back we don t know what s in the confounded thing you know i saw a young man a shop assistant in woking i believe he was standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again the crowd had pushed him in the end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within nearly two feet of shining screw projected somebody blundered against me and i narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw i turned and as i did so the screw must have come out for the lid of the cylinder fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion i stuck my elbow into the person behind me and turned my head towards the thing again for a moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black i had the sunset in my eyes i think everyone expected to see a man emerge possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men but in all essentials a man i know i did but looking i presently saw something stirring within the shadow greyish billowy movements one above another and then two luminous disks like eyes then something resembling a little grey snake about the thickness of a walking stick coiled up out of the writhing middle and wriggled in the air towards me and then another a sudden chill came over me there was a loud shriek from a woman behind i half turned keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still from which other tentacles were now projecting and began pushing my way back from the edge of the pit i saw astonishment {

giving place to horror on the faces of the people about me i heard inarticulate {

exclamations on all sides there was a general movement backwards i saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit i found myself alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off stent among them i looked again at the cylinder and ungovernable {

terror gripped me i stood petrified and staring a big greyish rounded bulk the size perhaps of a bear was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder as it bulged up and caught the light it glistened like wet leather two large dark coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly { 	
standfast:0 steadfast:5 }

the mass that framed them the head of the thing was rounded and had one might say a face there was a mouth under the eyes the lipless brim of which quivered and panted and dropped saliva the whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively {

of the tedious movements unspeakably {

nasty even at this first encounter this first glimpse i was overcome with disgust and dread suddenly the monster vanished it had toppled over the brim of the cylinder and fallen into the pit with a thud like the fall of a great mass of leather i heard it give a peculiar thick cry and forthwith another of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the aperture i turned and running madly made for the first group of trees perhaps a hundred yards away but i ran slantingly and stumbling for i could not avert my face from these things there among some young pine trees and furze bushes i stopped panting and waited further developments the common round the sand pits was dotted with people standing like myself in a half fascinated terror staring at these creatures or rather at the heaped gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay and then with a renewed horror i saw a round black object bobbing up and down on the edge of the pit it was the head of the shopman who had fallen in but showing as a little black object against the hot western sun now he got his shoulder and knee up and again he seemed to slip back until only his head was visible suddenly he vanished and i could have fancied a faint shriek had reached me i had a momentary impulse to go back and help him that my fears overruled everything was then quite invisible hidden by the deep pit and the heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made anyone coming along the road from chobham or woking would have been amazed at the sight a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more standing in a great irregular circle in ditches behind bushes behind gates and hedges saying little to one another and that in short excited shouts and staring staring hard at a few heaps of sand the barrow of ginger beer stood a queer derelict black against the burning sky and in the sand pits was a row of deserted vehicles with their horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the ground chapter five the heat ray after the glimpse i had had of the martians emerging from the cylinder in which they had come to the earth from their planet a kind of fascination {

paralysed my actions i remained standing knee deep in the heather staring at the mound that hid them i was a battleground { 	
battledoor:-1 battledore:-1 }

of fear and curiosity i did not dare to go back towards the pit but i felt a passionate longing to peer into it i began walking therefore in a big curve seeking some point of vantage and continually {

looking at the sand heaps that hid these new comers to our earth once a leash of thin black whips like the arms of an octopus flashed across the sunset and was immediately {

withdrawn and afterwards a thin rod rose up joint by joint bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling motion what could be going on there most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups one a little crowd towards woking the other a knot of people in the direction of chobham evidently they shared my mental conflict there were few near me one man i approached he was i perceived a neighbour of mine though i did not know his name and accosted but it was scarcely a time for articulate conversation { 	
conservant:2 containers:-1 convenors:-1 conversant:4 conversing:0 conversion:3 converting:-1 convertors:-1 }

what ugly brutes he said good god what ugly brutes he repeated this over and over again did you see a man in the pit i said but he made no answer to that we became silent and stood watching for a time side by side deriving i fancy a certain comfort in one another s company then i shifted my position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more of elevation and when i looked for him presently he was walking towards woking the sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened the crowd far away on the left towards woking seemed to grow and i heard now a faint murmur from it the little knot of people towards chobham dispersed there was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit it was this as much as anything that gave people courage and i suppose the new arrivals from woking also helped to restore confidence at any rate as the dusk came on a slow intermittent { 	
interment:0 interments:-1 intermit:0 intermits:-1 intertwine:-1 }

movement upon the sand pits began a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance stop watch and advance again spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns i too on my side began to move towards the pit then i saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels i saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples and then within thirty yards of the pit advancing from the direction of horsell i noted a little black knot of men the foremost of whom was waving a white flag this was the deputation there had been a hasty consultation { 	
consulta:0 consultant:4 consulting:0 convulsant:-1 }

and since the martians were evidently in spite of their repulsive forms intelligent creatures it had been resolved to show them by approaching { 	
anamorphic:-1 approach:2 approached:0 approaches:0 paraphonic:-1 }

them with signals that we too were intelligent flutter flutter went the flag first to the right then to the left it was too far for me to recognise anyone there but afterwards i learned that ogilvy stent and henderson were with others in this attempt at communication { 	
communion:-1 }

this little group had in its advance dragged inward so to speak the circumference of the now almost complete circle of people and a number of dim black figures followed it at discreet distances suddenly there was a flash of light and a quantity of luminous greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs which drove up one after the other straight into the still air this smoke or flame perhaps would be the better word for it was so bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown common towards chertsey set with black pine trees seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs arose and to remain the darker after their dispersal at the same time a faint hissing sound became audible beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at its apex arrested by these phenomena a little knot of small vertical black shapes upon the black ground as the green smoke arose their faces flashed out pallid green and faded again as it vanished then slowly the hissing passed into a humming into a long loud droning noise slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit and the ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it forthwith flashes of actual flame a bright glare leaping from one to another sprang from the scattered group of men it was as if some invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame it was as if each man were suddenly and momentarily { 	
momenta:-1 momentany:0 momentary:4 momently:0 montelimar:0 orientally:-1 }

turned to fire then by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and falling and their supporters turning to run i stood staring not as yet realising that this was death leaping from man to man in that little distant crowd all i felt was that it was something very strange an almost noiseless and blinding flash of light and a man fell headlong and lay still and as the unseen shaft of heat passed over them pine trees burst into fire and every dry furze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames and far away towards knaphill { 	
phallin:0 }

i saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden buildings suddenly set alight it was sweeping round swiftly and steadily this flaming death this invisible inevitable sword of heat i perceived it coming towards me by the flashing bushes it touched and was too astounded and stupefied to stir i heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled then it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather between me and the martians and all along a curving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from woking station opens out on the common forth with the hissing and humming ceased and the black dome like object sank slowly out of sight into the pit all this had happened with such swiftness that i had stood motionless dumbfounded { 	
dumbfound:5 dumbfounds:4 dumfounded:1 }

and dazzled by the flashes of light had that death swept through a full circle it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise but it passed and spared me and left the night about me suddenly dark and unfamiliar the undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness except where its roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the early night it was dark and suddenly void of men overhead the stars were mustering and in the west the sky was still a pale bright almost greenish blue the tops of the pine trees and the roofs of horsell came out sharp and black against the western afterglow the martians and their appliances were altogether invisible save for that thin mast upon which their restless mirror wobbled patches of bush and isolated trees here and there smoked and glowed still and the houses towards woking station were sending up spires of flame into the stillness of the evening air nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment the little group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out of existence and the stillness of the evening so it seemed to me had scarcely been broken it came to me that i was upon this dark common helpless unprotected and alone suddenly like a thing falling upon me from without came fear with an effort i turned and began a stumbling run through the heather the fear i felt was no rational fear but a panic terror not only of the martians but of the dusk and stillness all about me such an extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that i ran weeping silently as a child might do once i had turned i did not dare to look back i remember i felt an extraordinary persuasion that i was being played with that presently when i was upon the very verge of safety this mysterious death as swift as the passage of light would leap after me from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down chapter six the heat ray in the chobham road it is still a matter of wonder how the martians are able to slay men so swiftly and so silently many think that in some way they are able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically {

and all night long the common from horsell to maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze the news of the massacre probably reached chobham woking and ottershaw about the same time in woking the shops had closed when the tragedy happened and a number of people shop people and so forth attracted by the stories they had heard were walking over the horsell bridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon the common you may imagine the young people brushed up after the labours of the day and making this novelty as they would make any novelty the excuse for walking together and enjoying a trivial flirtation you may figure to yourself the hum of voices along the road in the gloaming as yet of course few people in woking even knew that the cylinder had opened though poor henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to the post office with a special wire to an evening paper as these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open they found little knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the spinning mirror over the sand pits and the newcomers were no doubt soon infected by the excitement of the occasion by half past eight when the deputation was destroyed there may have been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place besides those who had left the road to approach the martians nearer there were three policemen too one of whom was mounted doing their best under instructions {

the lower part of the heat ray saved them had the elevation of the parabolic mirror been a few yards higher none could have lived to tell the tale they saw the flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand as it were lit the bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight then with a whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit the beam swung close over their heads lighting the tops of the beech trees that line the road and splitting the bricks smashing the windows firing the window frames and bringing down in crumbling ruin a portion of the gable of the house nearest the corner in the sudden thud hiss and glare of the igniting trees the panic stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly {

for some moments sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road and single leaves like puffs of flame hats and dresses caught fire then came a crying from the common there were shrieks and shouts and suddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion with his hands clasped over his head screaming they re coming a woman shrieked and incontinently everyone was turning and pushing at those behind in order to clear their way to woking again they must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep where the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd jammed and a desperate struggle occurred all that crowd did not escape three persons at least two women and a little boy were crushed and trampled there and left to die amid the terror and the darkness chapter seven how i reached home for my own part i remember nothing of my flight except the stress of blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather all about me gathered the invisible terrors of the martians that pitiless sword of heat seemed whirling to and fro flourishing {

overhead before it descended and smote me out of life i came into the road between the crossroads and horsell and ran along this to the crossroads at last i could go no further i was exhausted with the violence of my emotion and of my flight and i staggered and fell by the wayside that was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks {

i fell and lay still i must have remained there some time i sat up strangely perplexed for a moment perhaps i could not clearly understand how i came there my terror had fallen from me like a garment my hat had gone and my collar had burst away from its fastener a few minutes before there had only been three real things before me the immensity of the night and space and nature my own feebleness and anguish and the near approach of death now it was as if something turned over and the point of view altered abruptly there was no sensible transition from one state of mind to the other i was immediately the self of every day again a decent ordinary citizen the silent common the impulse of my flight the starting flames were as if they had been in a dream i asked myself had these latter things indeed happened i could not credit it i rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge my mind was blank wonder my muscles and nerves seemed drained of their strength i dare say i staggered drunkenly a head rose over the arch and the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared beside him ran a little boy he passed me wishing me good night i was minded to speak to him but did not i answered his greeting with a meaningless {

of this serenity and the swift death flying yonder not two miles away there was a noise of business from the gasworks and the electric lamps were all alight i stopped at the group of people what news from the common said i there were two men and a woman at the gate eh said one of the men turning what news from the common i said ain t yer {

hear more yet i said and went on to my home i startled my wife at the doorway so haggard was i i went into the dining room sat down drank some wine and so soon as i could collect myself sufficiently {

i told her the things i had seen the dinner which was a cold one had already been served and remained neglected on the table while i told my story there is one thing i said to allay the fears i had aroused they are the most sluggish things i ever saw crawl they may keep the pit and kill people who come near them but they cannot get out of it but the horror of them don t dear said my wife knitting her brows and putting her hand on mine poor ogilvy i said to think he may be lying dead there my wife at least did not find my experience incredible when i saw how deadly white her face was i ceased abruptly they may come here she said again and again i pressed her to take wine and tried to reassure her they can scarcely move i said i began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that ogilvy had told me of the impossibility { 	
impossible:-1 impossibly:2 }

of the martians establishing {

themselves on the earth in particular i laid stress on the gravitational difficulty on the surface of the earth the force of gravity is three times what it is on the surface of mars a martian therefore would weigh three times more than on mars albeit his muscular strength would be the same his own body would be a cope of lead to him that indeed was the general opinion both the times and the daily telegraph for instance insisted on it the next morning and both overlooked just as i did two obvious modifying influences the atmosphere of the earth we now know contains far more oxygen or far less argon whichever way one likes to put it than does mars the invigorating { 	
invigorant:4 invigorate:2 }

influences of this excess of oxygen upon the martians indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their bodies and in the second place we all overlooked the fact that such mechanical intelligence as the martian possessed was quite able to dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch but i did not consider these points at the time and so my reasoning was dead against the chances of the invaders with wine and food the confidence of my own table and the necessity of reassuring my wife i grew by insensible degrees courageous and secure they have done a foolish thing said i fingering my wineglass {

they are dangerous because no doubt they are mad with terror perhaps they expected to find no living things certainly no intelligent living things a shell in the pit said i if the worst comes to the worst will kill them all the intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my perceptive powers in a state of erethism i remember that dinner table with extraordinary vividness even now my dear wife s sweet anxious face peering at me from under the pink lamp shade the white cloth with its silver and glass table furniture for in those days even philosophical {

habits of our social order with the first beginnings of the series of events that was to topple that social order headlong if on friday night you had taken a pair of compasses and drawn a circle with a radius of five miles round the woking sand pits i doubt if you would have had one human being outside it unless it were some relation of stent or of the three or four cyclists or london people lying dead on the common whose emotions or habits were at all affected by the new comers many people had heard of the cylinder of course and talked about it in their leisure but it certainly did not make the sensation that an ultimatum to germany {

from him and receiving no reply the man was killed decided not to print a special edition even within the five mile circle the great majority of people were inert i have already described the behaviour of the men and women to whom i spoke all over the district people were dining and supping working men were gardening after the labours of the day children were being put to bed young people were wandering through the lanes love making students sat over their books maybe there was a murmur in the village streets a novel and dominant topic in the public houses and here and there a messenger or even an eye witness of the later occurrences {

caused a whirl of excitement a shouting and a running to and fro but for the most part the daily routine of working eating drinking sleeping went on as it had done for countless years as though no planet mars existed in the sky even at woking station and horsell and chobham that was the case in woking junction until a late hour trains were stopping and going on others were shunting on the sidings passengers were alighting and waiting and everything was proceeding in the most ordinary way a boy from the town trenching on smith s monopoly was selling papers with the afternoon s news the ringing impact of trucks the sharp whistle of the engines from the junction mingled with their shouts of men from mars excited men came into the station about nine o clock with incredible tidings and caused no more disturbance {

swept the common and the heat ray was ready to follow save for such that big area of common was silent and desolate and the charred bodies lay about on it all night under the stars and all the next day a noise of hammering from the pit was heard by many people so you have the state of things on friday night in the centre sticking into the skin of our old planet earth like a poisoned dart was this cylinder but the poison was scarcely working yet around it was a patch of silent common smouldering {

t to be killed said the milkman if that can possibly be avoided i saw my neighbour gardening chatted with him for a time and then strolled in to breakfast it was a most unexceptional morning my neighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or to destroy the martians during the day it s a pity they make themselves so unapproachable he said it would be curious to know how they live on another planet we might learn a thing or two he came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries {

tell what they might do where s your shells said the first speaker there ain t no time do it in a rush that s my tip and do it at once so they discussed it after a while i left them and went on to the railway station to get as many morning papers as i could but i will not weary the reader with a description of that long morning and of the longer afternoon i did not succeed in getting a glimpse of the common for even horsell and chobham church towers were in the hands of the military authorities the soldiers i addressed didn {

that his son was among the dead on the common the soldiers had made the people on the outskirts of horsell lock up and leave their houses i got back to lunch about two very tired for as i have said the day was extremely hot and dull and in order to refresh myself i took a cold bath in the afternoon about half past four i went up to the railway station to get an evening paper for the morning papers had contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of stent henderson ogilvy and the others but there was little i didn t know the martians did not show an inch of themselves they seemed busy in their pit and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous streamer of smoke apparently they were busy getting ready for a struggle fresh attempts have been made to signal but without success was the stereotyped { 	
pretested:-1 stereobate:-1 stereotomy:-1 stereotype:8 stereotypy:4 }

formula of the papers a sapper told me it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole the martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the lowing of a cow i must confess the sight of all this armament all this preparation {

greatly excited me my imagination {

became belligerent { 	
belleter:-1 tellering:-1 }

and defeated the invaders in a dozen striking ways something of my schoolboy dreams of battle and heroism came back it hardly seemed a fair fight to me at that time they seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs about three o clock there began the thud of a gun at measured intervals from chertsey or addlestone { 	
adderstone:5 addlement:0 adolescent:3 desolated:-1 drakestone:0 fieldstone:0 saddlenose:-1 }

i learned that the smouldering pine wood into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled in the hope of destroying that object before it opened it was only about five however that a field gun reached chobham for use against the first body of martians about six in the evening as i sat at tea with my wife in the summerhouse { 	
humourless:-1 summerset:-1 }

talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon us i heard a muffled detonation from the common and immediately after a gust of firing close on the heels of that came a violent rattling crash quite close to us that shook the ground and starting out upon the lawn i saw the tops of the trees about the oriental college burst into smoky red flame and the tower of the little church beside it slide down into ruin the pinnacle of the mosque had vanished and the roof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred ton gun had been at work upon it one of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it flew and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap of broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window i and my wife stood amazed then i realised that the crest of maybury hill must be within range of the martians heat ray now that the college was cleared out of the way at that i gripped my wife s arm and without ceremony ran her out into the road then i fetched out the servant telling her i would go upstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for we can t possibly stay here i said and as i spoke the firing reopened for a moment upon the common but where are we to go said my wife in terror i thought perplexed then i remembered her cousins at leatherhead { 	
featherbed:-1 feathered:-1 leather:-1 leathered:3 weathered:-1 }

leatherhead i shouted above the sudden noise she looked away from me downhill the people were coming out of their houses astonished how are we to get to leatherhead she said down the hill i saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway bridge three galloped through the open gates of the oriental college two others dismounted and began running from house to house the sun shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the trees seemed blood red and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything stop here said i you are safe here and i started off at once for the spotted dog for i knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart i ran for i perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the hill would be moving i found him in his bar quite unaware of what was going on behind his house a man stood with his back to me talking to him i must have a pound said the landlord and i ve {

bring it back by midnight i said lord said the landlord what s the hurry i m selling my bit of a pig two pounds and you bring it back what s going on now i explained hastily that i had to leave my home and so secured the dog cart at the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the landlord should leave his i took care to have the cart there and then drove it off down the road and leaving it in charge of my wife and servant rushed into my house and packed a few valuables such plate as we had and so forth the beech trees below the house were burning while i did this and the palings up the road glowed red while i was occupied in this way one of the dismounted hussars came running up he was going from house to house warning people to leave he was going on as i came out of my front door lugging my treasures done up in a tablecloth i shouted after him what news he turned stared bawled something about crawling out in a thing like a dish cover and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest a sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a moment i ran to my neighbour s door and rapped to satisfy myself of what i already knew that his wife had gone to london with him and had locked up their house i went in again according to my promise to get my servant s box lugged it out clapped it beside her on the tail of the dog cart and then caught the reins and jumped up into the driver s seat beside my wife in another moment we were clear of the smoke and noise and spanking down the opposite slope of maybury hill towards old woking in front was a quiet sunny landscape a wheat field ahead on either side of the road and the maybury inn with its swinging sign i saw the doctor s cart ahead of me at the bottom of the hill i turned my head to look at the hillside i was leaving thick streamers of black smoke shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still air and throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward the smoke already extended far away to the east and west to the byfleet pine woods eastward and to woking on the west the road was dotted with people running towards us and very faint now but very distinct through the hot quiet air one heard the whirr of a machine gun that was presently stilled and an intermittent cracking of rifles apparently the martians were setting fire to everything within range of their heat ray i am not an expert driver and i had immediately to turn my attention to the horse when i looked back again the second hill had hidden the black smoke i slashed the horse with the whip and gave him a loose rein until woking and send lay between us and that quivering tumult i overtook and passed the doctor between woking and send chapter ten in the storm leatherhead is about twelve miles from maybury hill the scent of hay was in the air through the lush meadows beyond pyrford { 	
perforated:-1 perform:-1 performed:0 preformed:-1 pyriform:-1 }

and the hedges on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog roses the heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down maybury hill ceased as abruptly as it began leaving the evening very peaceful and still we got to leatherhead without misadventure { 	
misventure:-1 }

about nine o clock and the horse had an hour s rest while i took supper with my cousins and commended my wife to their care my wife was curiously silent throughout the drive and seemed oppressed with forebodings {

of evil i talked to her reassuringly {

pointing out that the martians were tied to the pit by sheer heaviness and at the utmost could but crawl a little out of it but she answered only in monosyllables had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper she would i think have urged me to stay in leatherhead that night would that i had her face i remember was very white as we parted for my own part i had been feverishly excited all day something very like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community had got into my blood and in my heart i was not so very sorry that i had to return to maybury that night i was even afraid that that last fusillade i had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from mars i can best express my state of mind by saying that i wanted to be in at the death it was nearly eleven when i started to return the night was unexpectedly {

dark to me walking out of the lighted passage of my cousins house it seemed indeed black and it was as hot and close as the day overhead the clouds were driving fast albeit not a breath stirred the shrubs about us my cousins man lit both lamps happily i knew the road intimately my wife stood in the light of the doorway and watched me until i jumped up into the dog cart then abruptly she turned and went in leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good hap i was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wife s fears but very soon my thoughts reverted to the martians at that time i was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evening s fighting i did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated {

the conflict as i came through ockham {

for that was the way i returned and not through send and old woking i saw along the western horizon a blood red glow which as i drew nearer crept slowly up the sky the driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm {

street was deserted and except for a lighted window or so the village showed not a sign of life but i narrowly escaped an accident at the corner of the road to pyrford where a knot of people stood with their backs to me they said nothing to me as i passed i do not know what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill nor do i know if the silent houses i passed on my way were sleeping securely or deserted and empty or harassed and watching against the terror of the night from ripley until i came through pyrford i was in the valley of the wey and the red glare was hidden from me as i ascended the little hill beyond pyrford church the glare came into view again and the trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that was upon me then i heard midnight pealing out from pyrford church behind me and then came the silhouette of maybury hill with its tree tops and roofs black and sharp against the red even as i beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and showed the distant woods towards addlestone i felt a tug at the reins i saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a thread of green fire suddenly lighting their confusion and falling into the field to my left it was the third falling star close on its apparition and blindingly {

violet by contrast danced out the first lightning of the gathering storm and the thunder burst like a rocket overhead the horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted a moderate incline runs towards the foot of maybury hill and down this we clattered once the lightning had begun it went on in as rapid a succession of flashes as i have ever seen the thunderclaps { 	
thunders:-1 }

treading one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling accompaniment sounded more like the working of a gigantic electric machine than the usual detonating reverberations the flickering light was blinding and confusing and a thin hail smote gustily {

at my face as i drove down the slope at first i regarded little but the road before me and then abruptly my attention was arrested by something that was moving rapidly down the opposite slope of maybury hill at first i took it for the wet roof of a house but one flash following another showed it to be in swift rolling movement it was an elusive vision a moment of bewildering {

darkness and then in a flash like daylight the red masses of the orphanage near the crest of the hill the green tops of the pine trees and this problematical object came out clear and sharp and bright and this thing i saw how can i describe it a monstrous tripod higher than many houses striding over the young pine trees and smashing them aside in its career a walking engine of glittering metal striding now across the heather articulate ropes of steel dangling from it and the clattering tumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder a flash and it came out vividly heeling over one way with two feet in the air to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed with the next flash a hundred yards nearer can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground that was the impression those instant flashes gave but instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery on a tripod stand then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted as brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them they were snapped off and driven headlong and a second huge tripod appeared rushing as it seemed headlong towards me and i was galloping hard to meet it at the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether not stopping to look again i wrenched the horse s head hard round to the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled over upon the horse the shafts smashed noisily and i was flung sideways and fell heavily into a shallow pool of water i crawled out almost immediately and crouched my feet still in the water under a clump of furze the horse lay motionless his neck was broken poor brute and by the lightning flashes i saw the black bulk of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still spinning slowly in another moment the colossal mechanism went striding by me and passed uphill towards pyrford seen nearer the thing was incredibly strange for it was no mere insensate machine driving on its way machine it was with a ringing metallic pace and long flexible glittering tentacles one of which gripped a young pine tree swinging and rattling about its strange body it picked its road as it went striding along and the brazen hood that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a head looking about behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal like a gigantic fisherman s basket and puffs of green smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me and in an instant it was gone so much i saw then all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning in blinding highlights and dense black shadows as it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the thunder aloo {

aloo and in another minute it was with its companion half a mile away stooping over something in the field i have no doubt this thing in the field was the third of the ten cylinders they had fired at us from mars for some minutes i lay there in the rain and darkness watching by the intermittent light these monstrous beings of metal moving about in the distance over the hedge tops a thin hail was now beginning and as it came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into clearness again now and then came a gap in the lightning and the night swallowed them up i was soaked with hail above and puddle water below it was some time before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to a drier position or think at all of my imminent peril not far from me was a little one roomed squatter s hut of wood surrounded by a patch of potato garden i struggled to my feet at last and crouching and making use of every chance of cover i made a run for this i hammered at the door but i could not make the people hear if there were any people inside and after a time i desisted and availing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way succeeded in crawling unobserved by these monstrous machines into the pine woods towards maybury under cover of this i pushed on wet and shivering now towards my own house i walked among the trees trying to find the footpath it was very dark indeed in the wood for the lightning was now becoming infrequent and the hail which was pouring down in a torrent fell in columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage if i had fully realised the meaning of all the things i had seen i should have immediately worked my way round through byfleet to street cobham {

and so gone back to rejoin my wife at leatherhead but that night the strangeness of things about me and my physical wretchedness { 	
wrenched:-1 wretched:0 wretches:-1 }

prevented me for i was bruised weary wet to the skin deafened and blinded by the storm i had a vague idea of going on to my own house and that was as much motive as i had i staggered through the trees fell into a ditch and bruised my knees against a plank and finally splashed out into the lane that ran down from the college arms i say splashed for the storm water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent there in the darkness a man blundered into me and sent me reeling back he gave a cry of terror sprang sideways and rushed on before i could gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him so heavy was the stress of the storm just at this place that i had the hardest task to win my way up the hill i went close up to the fence on the left and worked my way along its palings near the top i stumbled upon something soft and by a flash of lightning saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of boots before i could distinguish { 	
dishings:0 distingue:1 distinguee:0 disunities:-1 histidines:0 }

clearly how the man lay the flicker of light had passed i stood over him waiting for the next flash when it came i saw that he was a sturdy man cheaply but not shabbily dressed his head was bent under his body and he lay crumpled up close to the fence as though he had been flung violently against it overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before touched a dead body i stooped and turned him over to feel for his heart he was quite dead apparently his neck had been broken the lightning flashed for a third time and his face leaped upon me i sprang to my feet it was the landlord of the spotted dog whose conveyance i had taken i stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill i made my way by the police station and the college arms towards my own house nothing was burning on the hillside though from the common there still came a red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the drenching hail so far as i could see by the flashes the houses about me were mostly uninjured by the college arms a dark heap lay in the road down the road towards maybury bridge there were voices and the sound of feet but i had not the courage to shout or to go to them i let myself in with my latchkey closed locked and bolted the door staggered to the foot of the staircase and sat down my imagination was full of those striding metallic monsters and of the dead body smashed against the fence i crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall shivering violently chapter eleven at the window i have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of exhausting themselves after a time i discovered that i was cold and wet and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet i got up almost mechanically { 	
alchemical:1 mechanic:0 mechanical:6 mechanics:-1 }

went into the dining room and drank some whiskey and then i was moved to change my clothes after i had done that i went upstairs to my study but why i did so i do not know the window of my study looks over the trees and the railway towards horsell common in the hurry of our departure this window had been left open the passage was dark and by contrast with the picture the window frame enclosed the side of the room seemed impenetrably dark i stopped short in the doorway the thunderstorm had passed the towers of the oriental college and the pine trees about it had gone and very far away lit by a vivid red glare the common about the sand pits was visible across the light huge black shapes grotesque and strange moved busily to and fro it seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on fire a broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame swaying and writhing with the gusts of the dying storm and throwing a red reflection upon the cloud scud above every now and then a haze of smoke from some nearer conflagration { 	
conflating:0 conflation:0 }

drove across the window and hid the martian shapes i could not see what they were doing nor the clear form of them nor recognise the black objects they were busied upon neither could i see the nearer fire though the reflections {

of it danced on the wall and ceiling of the study a sharp resinous tang of burning was in the air i closed the door noiselessly { 	
looseness:-1 noiseless:5 shineless:-1 spineless:-1 }

and crept towards the window as i did so the view opened out until on the one hand it reached to the houses about woking station and on the other to the charred and blackened pine woods of byfleet there was a light down below the hill on the railway near the arch and several of the houses along the maybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins the light upon the railway puzzled me at first there were a black heap and a vivid glare and to the right of that a row of yellow oblongs then i perceived this was a wrecked train the fore part smashed and on fire the hinder carriages still upon the rails between these three main centres of light the houses the train and the burning county towards chobham stretched irregular patches of dark country broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and smoking ground it was the strangest spectacle that black expanse set with fire it reminded me more than anything else of the potteries at night at first i could distinguish no people at all though i peered intently for them later i saw against the light of woking station a number of black figures hurrying one after the other across the line and this was the little world in which i had been living securely for years this fiery chaos what had happened in the last seven hours i still did not know nor did i know though i was beginning to guess the relation between these mechanical colossi and the sluggish lumps i had seen disgorged from the cylinder with a queer feeling of impersonal interest i turned my desk chair to the window sat down and stared at the blackened country and particularly { 	
matricular:0 partially:-1 particular:6 }

at the three gigantic black things that were going to and fro in the glare about the sand pits they seemed amazingly busy i began to ask myself what they could be were they intelligent mechanisms such a thing i felt was impossible or did a martian sit within each ruling directing using much as a man s brain sits and rules in his body i began to compare the things to human machines to ask myself for the first time in my life how an ironclad or a steam engine would seem to an intelligent lower animal the storm had left the sky clear and over the smoke of the burning land the little fading pinpoint of mars was dropping into the west when a soldier came into my garden i heard a slight scraping at the fence and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me i looked down and saw him dimly clambering over the palings at the sight of another human being my torpor passed and i leaned out of the window eagerly hist said i in a whisper he stopped astride of the fence in doubt then he came over and across the lawn to the corner of the house he bent down and stepped softly who s there he said also whispering standing under the window and peering up where are you going i asked god knows are you trying to hide that s it come into the house i said i went down unfastened the door and let him in and locked the door again i could not see his face he was hatless and his coat was unbuttoned my god he said as i drew him in what has happened i asked what hasn {

t in the obscurity i could see he made a gesture of despair they wiped us out simply wiped us out he repeated again and again he followed me almost mechanically into the dining room take some whiskey i said pouring out a stiff dose he drank it then abruptly he sat down before the table put his head on his arms and began to sob and weep like a little boy in a perfect passion of emotion while i with a curious forgetfulness { 	
forgetful:1 }

of my own recent despair stood beside him wondering it was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my questions and then he answered perplexingly { 	
perplexing:6 perplexity:1 }

and brokenly he was a driver in the artillery and had only come into action about seven at that time firing was going on across the common and it was said the first party of martians were crawling slowly towards their second cylinder under cover of a metal shield later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first of the fighting machines i had seen the gun he drove had been unlimbered near horsell in order to command the sand pits and its arrival it was that had precipitated the action as the limber gunners went to the rear his horse trod in a rabbit hole and came down throwing him into a depression of the ground at the same moment the gun exploded behind him the ammunition blew up there was fire all about him and he found himself lying under a heap of charred dead men and dead horses i lay still he said scared out of my wits with the fore quarter of a horse atop of me we d been wiped out and the smell good god like burnt meat i was hurt across the back by the fall of the horse and there i had to lie until i felt better just like parade it had been a minute before then stumble bang swish wiped out he said he had hid under the dead horse for a long time peeping out furtively across the common the cardigan men had tried a rush in skirmishing {

order at the pit simply to be swept out of existence then the monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely to and fro across the common among the few fugitives with its headlike {

and out of the funnel of this there smoked the heat ray in a few minutes there was so far as the soldier could see not a living thing left upon the common and every bush and tree upon it that was not already a blackened skeleton was burning the hussars had been on the road beyond the curvature of the ground and he saw nothing of them he heard the martians rattle for a time and then become still the giant saved woking station and its cluster of houses until the last then in a moment the heat ray was brought to bear and the town became a heap of fiery ruins then the thing shut off the heat ray and turning its back upon the artilleryman { 	
armillary:1 artillery:3 }

began to waddle away towards the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second cylinder as it did so a second glittering titan built itself up out of the pit the second monster followed the first and at that the artilleryman began to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards horsell he managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the road and so escaped to woking there his story became ejaculatory { 	
ejaculate:1 ejaculated:0 ejaculates:0 }

the place was impassable it seems there were a few people alive there frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded he was turned aside by the fire and hid among some almost scorching heaps of broken wall as one of the martian giants returned he saw this one pursue a man catch him up in one of its steely tentacles and knock his head against the trunk of a pine tree at last after nightfall the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway embankment since then he had been skulking along towards maybury in the hope of getting out of danger londonward { 	
landowner:-1 wonderland:2 woodlander:-1 }

people were hiding in trenches and cellars and many of the survivors had made off towards woking village and send he had been consumed with thirst until he found one of the water mains near the railway arch smashed and the water bubbling out like a spring upon the road that was the story i got from him bit by bit he grew calmer telling me and trying to make me see the things he had seen he had eaten no food since midday he told me early in his narrative and i found some mutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into the room we lit no lamp for fear of attracting the martians and ever and again our hands would touch upon bread or meat as he talked things about us came darkly out of the darkness and the trampled bushes and broken rose trees outside the window grew distinct it would seem that a number of men or animals had rushed across the lawn i began to see his face blackened and haggard as no doubt mine was also when we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study and i looked again out of the open window in one night the valley had become a valley of ashes the fires had dwindled now where flames had been there were now streamers of smoke but the countless ruins of shattered and gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees that the night had hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn yet here and there some object had had the luck to escape a white railway signal here the end of a greenhouse there white and fresh amid the wreckage never before in the history of warfare had destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal and shining with the growing light of the east three of the metallic giants stood about the pit their cowls rotating as though they were surveying the desolation they had made it seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged and ever and again puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the brightening {

as the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we had watched the martians and went very quietly downstairs the artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in he proposed he said to make his way londonward and thence rejoin his battery no of the horse artillery my plan was to return at once to leatherhead and so greatly had the strength of the martians impressed me that i had determined to take my wife to newhaven { 	
inweave:-1 menhaden:-1 newsagent:-1 unweave:-1 }

and go with her out of the country forthwith for i already perceived clearly that the country about london must inevitably be the scene of a disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be destroyed between us and leatherhead however lay the third cylinder with its guarding giants had i been alone i think i should have taken my chance and struck across country but the artilleryman dissuaded me it s no kindness to the right sort of wife he said to make her a widow and in the end i agreed to go with him under cover of the woods northward as far as street cobham before i parted with him thence i would make a big detour by epsom {

to reach leatherhead i should have started at once but my companion had been in active service and he knew better than that he made me ransack the house for a flask which he filled with whiskey and we lined every available pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat then we crept out of the house and ran as quickly as we could down the ill made road by which i had come overnight the houses seemed deserted in the road lay a group of three charred bodies close together struck dead by the heat ray and here and there were things that people had dropped a clock a slipper a silver spoon and the like poor valuables at the corner turning up towards the post office a little cart filled with boxes and furniture and horseless heeled over on a broken wheel a cash box had been hastily smashed open and thrown under the debris except the lodge at the orphanage which was still on fire none of the houses had suffered very greatly here the heat ray had shaved the chimney tops and passed yet save ourselves there did not seem to be a living soul on maybury hill the majority of the inhabitants had escaped i suppose by way of the old woking road the road i had taken when i drove to leatherhead or they had hidden we went down the lane by the body of the man in black sodden now from the overnight hail and broke into the woods at the foot of the hill we pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a soul the woods across the line were but the scarred and blackened ruins of woods for the most part the trees had fallen but a certain proportion still stood dismal grey stems with dark brown foliage instead of green on our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees it had failed to secure its footing in one place the woodmen had been at work on saturday trees felled and freshly trimmed lay in a clearing with heaps of sawdust by the sawing machine and its engine hard by was a temporary hut deserted there was not a breath of wind this morning and everything was strangely still even the birds were hushed and as we hurried along i and the artilleryman talked in whispers and looked now and again over our shoulders once or twice we stopped to listen after a time we drew near the road and as we did so we heard the clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers riding slowly towards woking we hailed them and they halted while we hurried towards them it was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of the th {

and tell him all you know he s at weybridge know the way i do i said and he turned his horse southward again half a mile you say said he at most i answered and pointed over the treetops southward he thanked me and rode on and we saw them no more farther along we came upon a group of three women and two children in the road busy clearing out a labourer s cottage they had got hold of a little hand truck and were piling it up with unclean looking bundles and shabby furniture they were all too assiduously {

engaged to talk to us as we passed by byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees and found the country calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight we were far beyond the range of the heat ray there and had it not been for the silent desertion of some of the houses the stirring movement of packing in others and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridge over the railway and staring down the line towards woking the day would have seemed very like any other sunday {

several farm waggons and carts were moving creakily along the road to addlestone and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw across a stretch of flat meadow six twelve pounders standing neatly at equal distances pointing towards woking the gunners stood by the guns waiting and the ammunition waggons were at a business like distance the men stood almost as if under inspection that s good said i they will get one fair shot at any rate the artilleryman hesitated at the gate i shall go on he said farther on towards weybridge just over the bridge there were a number of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart and more guns behind it s bows and arrows against the lightning anyhow said the artilleryman they aven {

and the men digging would stop every now and again to stare in the same direction byfleet was in a tumult people packing and a score of hussars some of them dismounted some on horseback were hunting them about three or four black government waggons with crosses in white circles and an old omnibus among other vehicles were being loaded in the village street there were scores of people most of them sufficiently sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes the soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their position we saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a score or more of flower pots containing orchids angrily expostulating with the corporal who would leave them behind i stopped and gripped his arm do you know what s over there i said pointing at the pine tops that hid the martians eh said he turning i was explainin {

and his bell was jangling out above the excitement i and the artilleryman seated on the step of the drinking fountain made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with us patrols of soldiers here no longer hussars but grenadiers in white were warning people to move now or to take refuge in their cellars as soon as the firing began we saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing crowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station and the swarming platform was piled with boxes and packages the ordinary traffic had been stopped i believe in order to allow of the passage of troops and guns to chertsey and i have heard since that a savage struggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at a later hour we remained at weybridge until midday and at that hour we found ourselves at the place near shepperton lock where the wey and thames {

join part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a little cart the wey has a treble mouth and at this point boats are to be hired and there was a ferry across the river on the shepperton side was an inn with a lawn and beyond that the tower of shepperton church it has been replaced by a spire rose above the trees here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives as yet the flight had not grown to a panic but there were already far more people than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross people came panting along under heavy burdens one husband and wife were even carrying a small outhouse door between them with some of their household goods piled thereon one man told us he meant to try to get away from shepperton station there was a lot of shouting and one man was even jesting the idea people seemed to have here was that the martians were simply formidable human beings who might attack and sack the town to be certainly destroyed in the end every now and then people would glance nervously across the wey at the meadows towards chertsey but everything over there was still across the thames except just where the boats landed everything was quiet in vivid contrast with the surrey side the people who landed there from the boats went tramping off down the lane the big ferryboat {

had just made a journey three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of the inn staring and jesting at the fugitives without offering to help the inn was closed as it was now within prohibited hours what s that cried a boatman and shut up you fool said a man near me to a yelping dog then the sound came again this time from the direction of chertsey a muffled thud the sound of a gun the fighting was beginning almost immediately unseen batteries across the river to our right unseen because of the trees took up the chorus firing heavily one after the other a woman screamed everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle near us and yet invisible to us nothing was to be seen save flat meadows cows feeding unconcernedly {

stop em said a woman beside me doubtfully a haziness rose over the treetops then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river a puff of smoke that jerked up into the air and hung and forthwith the ground heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air smashing two or three windows in the houses near and leaving us astonished here they are shouted a man in a blue jersey yonder d yer see them yonder quickly one after the other one two three four of the armoured martians appeared far away over the little trees across the flat meadows that stretched towards chertsey and striding hurriedly towards the river little cowled figures they seemed at first going with a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds then advancing obliquely towards us came a fifth their armoured bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the guns growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer one on the extreme left the remotest that is flourished a huge case high in the air and the ghostly terrible heat ray i had already seen on friday night smote towards chertsey and struck the town at sight of these strange swift and terrible creatures the crowd near the water s edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror struck there was no screaming or shouting but a silence then a hoarse murmur and a movement of feet a splashing from the water a man too frightened to drop the portmanteau {

he carried on his shoulder swung round and sent me staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden a woman thrust at me with her hand and rushed past me i turned with the rush of the people but i was not too terrified for thought the terrible heat ray was in my mind to get under water that was it get under water i shouted unheeded i faced about again and rushed towards the approaching martian rushed right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water others did the same a boatload { 	
botryoidal:-1 foldboat:-1 }

of people putting back came leaping out as i rushed past the stones under my feet were muddy and slippery and the river was so low that i ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waist deep then as the martian towered overhead scarcely a couple of hundred yards away i flung myself forward under the surface the splashes of the people in the boats leaping into the river sounded like thunderclaps in my ears people were landing hastily on both sides of the river but the martian machine took no more notice for the moment of the people running this way and that than a man would of the confusion of ants in a nest against which his foot has kicked when half suffocated i raised my head above water the martian s hood pointed at the batteries that were still firing across the river and as it advanced it swung loose what must have been the generator of the heat ray in another moment it was on the bank and in a stride wading halfway across the knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank and in another moment it had raised itself to its full height again close to the village of shepperton forthwith the six guns which unknown to anyone on the right bank had been hidden behind the outskirts of that village fired simultaneously the sudden near concussion the last close upon the first made my heart jump the monster was already raising the case generating the heat ray as the first shell burst six yards above the hood i gave a cry of astonishment i saw and thought nothing of the other four martian monsters my attention was riveted upon the nearer incident simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the body as the hood twisted round in time to receive but not in time to dodge the fourth shell the shell burst clean in the face of the thing the hood bulged flashed was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh and glittering metal hit shouted i with something between a scream and a cheer i heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me i could have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation the decapitated {

colossus reeled like a drunken giant but it did not fall over it recovered its balance by a miracle and no longer heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the heat ray now rigidly upheld it reeled swiftly upon shepperton the living intelligence the martian within the hood was slain and splashed to the four winds of heaven and the thing was now but a mere intricate device of metal whirling to destruction it drove along in a straight line incapable of guidance it struck the tower of shepperton church smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have done swerved aside blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force into the river out of my sight a violent explosion shook the air and a spout of water steam mud and shattered metal shot far up into the sky as the camera of the heat ray hit the water the latter had immediately flashed into steam in another moment a huge wave like a muddy tidal bore but almost scaldingly {

hot came sweeping round the bend upstream i saw people struggling shorewards and heard their screaming and shouting faintly above the seething and roar of the martian s collapse for a moment i heeded nothing of the heat forgot the patent need of self preservation { 	
overprints:-1 perversion:-1 preserving:0 }

i splashed through the tumultuous water pushing aside a man in black to do so until i could see round the bend half a dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the confusion of the waves the fallen martian came into sight downstream lying across the river and for the most part submerged thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage and through the tumultuously {

whirling wisps i could see intermittently and vaguely the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash and spray of mud and froth into the air the tentacles swayed and struck like living arms and save for the helpless purposelessness of these movements it was as if some wounded thing were struggling for its life amid the waves enormous quantities of a ruddy brown fluid were spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine my attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious yelling like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing towns a man knee deep near the towing path shouted inaudibly to me and pointed looking back i saw the other martians advancing with gigantic strides down the riverbank { 	
reverbing:-1 riverain:1 riverains:0 riverman:2 }

from the direction of chertsey the shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly { 	
unavailing:6 }

at that i ducked at once under water and holding my breath until movement was an agony blundered painfully ahead under the surface as long as i could the water was in a tumult about me and rapidly growing hotter when for a moment i raised my head to take breath and throw the hair and water from my eyes the steam was rising in a whirling white fog that at first hid the martians altogether the noise was deafening then i saw them dimly colossal figures of grey magnified by the mist they had passed by me and two were stooping over the frothing tumultuous ruins of their comrade the third and fourth stood beside him in the water one perhaps two hundred yards from me the other towards laleham {

the generators of the heat rays waved high and the hissing beams smote down this way and that the air was full of sound a deafening and confusing conflict of noises the clangorous din of the martians the crash of falling houses the thud of trees fences sheds flashing into flame and the crackling and roaring of fire dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with the steam from the river and as the heat ray went to and fro over weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames the nearer houses still stood intact awaiting their fate shadowy faint and pallid in the steam with the fire behind them going to and fro for a moment perhaps i stood there breast high in the almost boiling water dumbfounded at my position hopeless of escape through the reek i could see the people who had been with me in the river scrambling out of the water through the reeds like little frogs hurrying through grass from the advance of a man or running to and fro in utter dismay on the towing path then suddenly the white flashes of the heat ray came leaping towards me the houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch and darted out flames the trees changed to fire with a roar the ray flickered up and down the towing path licking off the people who ran this way and that and came down to the water s edge not fifty yards from where i stood it swept across the river to shepperton and the water in its track rose in a boiling weal crested with steam i turned shoreward in another moment the huge wave well nigh at the boiling point had rushed upon me i screamed aloud and scalded half blinded agonised i staggered through the leaping hissing water towards the shore had my foot stumbled it would have been the end i fell helplessly in full sight of the martians upon the broad bare gravelly spit that runs down to mark the angle of the wey and thames i expected nothing but death i have a dim memory of the foot of a martian coming down within a score of yards of my head driving straight into the loose gravel whirling it this way and that and lifting again of a long suspense and then of the four carrying the debris of their comrade between them now clear and then presently faint through a veil of smoke receding interminably as it seemed to me across a vast space of river and meadow and then very slowly i realised that by a miracle i had escaped chapter thirteen how i fell in with the curate after getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial weapons the martians retreated to their original position upon horsell common and in their haste and encumbered with the debris of their smashed companion they no doubt overlooked many such a stray and negligible victim as myself had they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith there was nothing at that time between them and london but batteries of twelve pounder guns and they would certainly have reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their approach as sudden dreadful and destructive {

everything from the second and third cylinders the second in addlestone golf links and the third at pyrford to their original pit on horsell common over that above the blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and wide stood one as sentinel while the rest abandoned their vast fighting machines and descended into the pit they were hard at work there far into the night and the towering pillar of dense green smoke that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about merrow {

and epsom downs and while the martians behind me were thus preparing for their next sally and in front of me humanity gathered for the battle i made my way with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning weybridge towards london i saw an abandoned boat very small and remote drifting down stream and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes i went after it gained it and so escaped out of that destruction there were no oars in the boat but i contrived to paddle as well as my parboiled hands would allow down the river towards halliford {

going very tediously and continually looking behind me as you may well understand i followed the river because i considered that the water gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return the hot water from the martian s overthrow drifted downstream with me so that for the best part of a mile i could see little of either bank once however i made out a string of black figures hurrying across the meadows from the direction of weybridge halliford it seemed was deserted and several of the houses facing the river were on fire it was strange to see the place quite tranquil quite desolate under the hot blue sky with the smoke and little threads of flame going straight up into the heat of the afternoon never before had i seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive {

crowd a little farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing and a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late field of hay for a long time i drifted so painful and weary was i after the violence i had been through and so intense the heat upon the water then my fears got the better of me again and i resumed my paddling the sun scorched my bare back at last as the bridge at walton was coming into sight round the bend my fever and faintness overcame my fears and i landed on the middlesex bank and lay down deadly sick amid the long grass i suppose the time was then about four or five o clock i got up presently walked perhaps half a mile without meeting a soul and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge i seem to remember talking wanderingly {

i do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate so that probably i dozed i became aware of him as a seated figure in soot smudged shirt sleeves and with his upturned clean shaven face staring at a faint flickering that danced over the sky the sky was what is called a mackerel sky rows and rows of faint down plumes of cloud just tinted with the midsummer sunset i sat up and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly have you any water i asked abruptly he shook his head you have been asking for water for the last hour he said for a moment we were silent taking stock of each other i dare say he found me a strange enough figure naked save for my water soaked trousers and socks scalded and my face and shoulders blackened by the smoke his face was a fair weakness his chin retreated and his hair lay in crisp almost flaxen curls on his low forehead his eyes were rather large pale blue and blankly staring he spoke abruptly looking vacantly away from me what does it mean he said what do these things mean i stared at him and made no answer he extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining {

and he heard nothing of the arrival until saturday morning the morning papers on saturday contained in addition to lengthy special articles on the planet mars on life in the planets and so forth a brief and vaguely worded telegram all the more striking for its brevity the martians alarmed by the approach of a crowd had killed a number of people with a quick firing gun so the story ran the telegram concluded with the words formidable as they seem to be the martians have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen and indeed seem incapable of doing so probably this is due to the relative strength of the earth s gravitational energy on that last text their leader writer expanded very comfortingly {

of course all the students in the crammer s biology class to which my brother went that day were intensely interested but there were no signs of any unusual excitement in the streets the afternoon papers puffed scraps of news under big headlines they had nothing to tell beyond the movements of troops about the common and the burning of the pine woods between woking and weybridge until eight then the st james s gazette in an extra special edition announced the bare fact of the interruption {

communication this was thought to be due to the falling of burning pine trees across the line nothing more of the fighting was known that night the night of my drive to leatherhead and back my brother felt no anxiety about us as he knew from the description in the papers that the cylinder was a good two miles from my house he made up his mind to run down that night to me in order as he says to see the things before they were killed he dispatched a telegram which never reached me about four o clock and spent the evening at a music hall in london also on saturday night there was a thunderstorm and my brother reached waterloo in a cab on the platform from which the midnight train usually starts he learned after some waiting that an accident prevented trains from reaching woking that night the nature of the accident he could not ascertain indeed the railway authorities did not clearly know at that time there was very little excitement in the station as the officials failing to realise that anything further than a breakdown between byfleet and woking junction had occurred were running the theatre trains which usually passed through woking round by virginia {

great anxiety prevails in west surrey and earthworks are being thrown up to check the advance londonward that was how the sunday sun put it and a clever and remarkably prompt handbook article in the referee compared the affair to a menagerie suddenly let loose in a village no one in london knew positively of the nature of the armoured martians and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be sluggish crawling creeping painfully such expressions {

of their advance the sunday papers printed separate editions as further news came to hand some even in default of it but there was practically nothing more to tell people until late in the afternoon when the authorities gave the press agencies the news in their possession it was stated that the people of walton and weybridge and all the district were pouring along the roads londonward and that was all my brother went to church at the foundling hospital in the morning still in ignorance of what had happened on the previous night there he heard allusions made to the invasion and a special prayer for peace coming out he bought a referee he became alarmed at the news in this and went again to waterloo station to find out if communication were restored the omnibuses carriages cyclists and innumerable {

machines nearly a hundred feet high capable of the speed of an express train and able to shoot out a beam of intense heat masked batteries chiefly of field guns had been planted in the country about horsell common and especially between the woking district and london five of the machines had been seen moving towards the thames and one by a happy chance had been destroyed in the other cases the shells had missed and the batteries had been at once annihilated {

by the heat rays heavy losses of soldiers were mentioned but the tone of the dispatch was optimistic the martians had been repulsed they were not invulnerable they had retreated to their triangle of cylinders again in the circle about woking signallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon them from all sides guns were in rapid transit from windsor portsmouth aldershot woolwich even from the north among others long wire guns of ninety five tons from woolwich altogether one hundred and sixteen were in position or being hastily placed chiefly covering london never before in england had there been such a vast or rapid concentration {

no doubt ran the report the situation was of the strangest and gravest description but the public was exhorted to avoid and discourage panic no doubt the martians were strange and terrible in the extreme but at the outside there could not be more than twenty of them against our millions the authorities had reason to suppose from the size of the cylinders that at the outside there could not be more than five in each cylinder fifteen altogether and one at least was disposed of perhaps more the public would be fairly warned of the approach of danger and elaborate measures were being taken for the protection of the people in the threatened southwestern {

locked up my house and come on at the time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the authorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the invaders without all this inconvenience about eight o clock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audible all over the south of london my brother could not hear it for the traffic in the main thoroughfares but by striking through the quiet back streets to the river he was able to distinguish it quite plainly he walked from westminster to his apartments near regent s park about two he was now very anxious on my account and disturbed at the evident magnitude of the trouble his mind was inclined to run even as mine had run on saturday on military details he thought of all those silent expectant guns of the suddenly nomadic countryside {

albeit they talked in groups and along the edge of regent s park there were as many silent couples walking out together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there had been the night was warm and still and a little oppressive the sound of guns continued intermittently and after midnight there seemed to be sheet lightning in the south he read and re read the paper fearing the worst had happened to me he was restless and after supper prowled out again aimlessly he returned and tried in vain to divert his attention to his examination notes he went to bed a little after midnight and was awakened from lurid dreams in the small hours of monday by the sound of door knockers feet running in the street distant drumming and a clamour of bells red reflections danced on the ceiling for a moment he lay astonished wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad then he jumped out of bed and ran to the window his room was an attic and as he thrust his head out up and down the street there were a dozen echoes to the noise of his window sash and heads in every kind of night disarray appeared enquiries were being shouted they are coming bawled a policeman hammering at the door the martians are coming and hurried to the next door the sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the albany {

as my brother began to realise the import of all these things he turned hastily to his own room put all his available money some ten pounds altogether into his pockets and went out again into the streets chapter fifteen what had happened in surrey it was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under the hedge in the flat meadows near halliford and while my brother was watching the fugitives stream over westminster bridge that the martians had resumed the offensive so far as one can ascertain from the conflicting {

as if they had been on parade and fired at about a thousand yards range the shells flashed all round him and he was seen to advance a few paces stagger and go down everybody yelled together and the guns were reloaded in frantic haste the overthrown martian set up a prolonged ululation and immediately a second glittering giant answering him appeared over the trees to the south it would seem that a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells the whole of the second volley flew wide of the martian on the ground and simultaneously both his companions brought their heat rays to bear on the battery the ammunition blew up the pine trees all about the guns flashed into fire and only one or two of the men who were already running over the crest of the hill escaped after this it would seem that the three took counsel together and halted and the scouts who were watching them report that they remained absolutely stationary for the next half hour the martian who had been overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood a small brown figure oddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of blight and apparently engaged in the repair of his support about nine he had finished for his cowl was then seen above the trees again it was a few minutes past nine that night when these three sentinels were joined by four other martians each carrying a thick black tube a similar tube was handed to each of the three and the seven proceeded to distribute themselves at equal distances along a curved line between st george s hill weybridge and the village of send southwest {

at the same time four of their fighting machines similarly armed with tubes crossed the river and two of them black against the western sky came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and painfully along the road that runs northward out of halliford they moved as it seemed to us upon a cloud for a milky mist covered the fields and rose to a third of their height at this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat and began running but i knew it was no good running from a martian and i turned aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad ditch by the side of the road he looked back saw what i was doing and turned to join me the two halted the nearer to us standing and facing sunbury the remoter being a grey indistinctness {

with a heavy report that made the ground heave the one towards staines answered him there was no flash no smoke simply that loaded detonation i was so excited by these heavy minute guns following one another that i so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber up into the hedge and stare towards sunbury as i did so a second report followed and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards hounslow i expected at least to see smoke or fire or some such evidence of its work but all i saw was the deep blue sky above with one solitary star and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath and there had been no crash no answering explosion the silence was restored the minute lengthened to three what has happened said the curate standing up beside me heaven knows said i a bat flickered by and vanished a distant tumult of shouting began and ceased i looked again at the martian and saw he was now moving eastward along the riverbank with a swift rolling motion every moment i expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring upon him but the evening calm was unbroken the figure of the martian grew smaller as he receded and presently the mist and the gathering night had swallowed him up by a common impulse we clambered higher towards sunbury was a dark appearance as though a conical hill had suddenly come into being there hiding our view of the farther country and then remoter across the river over walton we saw another such summit these hill like forms grew lower and broader even as we stared moved by a sudden thought i looked northward and there i perceived a third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen everything had suddenly become very still far away to the southeast {

marking the quiet we heard the martians hooting to one another and then the air quivered again with the distant thud of their guns but the earthly artillery made no reply now at the time we could not understand these things but later i was to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the twilight each of the martians standing in the great crescent i have described had discharged by means of the gunlike {

tube he carried a huge canister over whatever hill copse cluster of houses or other possible cover for guns chanced to be in front of him some fired only one of these some two as in the case of the one we had seen the one at ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at that time these canisters smashed on striking the ground they did not explode and incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy inky vapour coiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud a gaseous hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country and the touch of that vapour the inhaling of its pungent wisps was death to all that breathes it was heavy this vapour heavier than the densest smoke so that after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact it sank down through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather liquid than gaseous abandoning the hills and streaming into the valleys and ditches and watercourses { 	
watercress:2 }

even as i have heard the carbonic acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do and where it came upon water some chemical action occurred and the surface would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and made way for more the scum was absolutely insoluble and it is a strange thing seeing the instant effect of the gas that one could drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained the vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do it hung together in banks flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving reluctantly {

before the wind and very slowly it combined with the mist and moisture of the air and sank to the earth in the form of dust save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue of the spectrum is concerned we are still entirely ignorant of the nature of this substance once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over the black smoke clung so closely to the ground even before its precipitation { 	
precipitin:2 }

that fifty feet up in the air on the roofs and upper stories of high houses and on great trees there was a chance of escaping its poison altogether as was proved even that night at street cobham and ditton the man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of the strangeness of its coiling flow and how he looked down from the church spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out of its inky nothingness {

for a day and a half he remained there weary starving and sun scorched the earth under the blue sky and against the prospect of the distant hills a velvet black expanse with red roofs green trees and later black veiled shrubs and gates barns outhouses and walls rising here and there into the sunlight but that was at street cobham where the black vapour was allowed to remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground as a rule the martians when it had served its purpose cleared the air of it again by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it this they did with the vapour banks near us as we saw in the starlight from the window of a deserted house at upper halliford whither we had returned from there we could see the searchlights on richmond hill and kingston hill going to and fro and about eleven the windows rattled and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been put in position there these continued intermittently for the space of a quarter of an hour sending chance shots at the invisible martians at hampton and ditton and then the pale beams of the electric light vanished and were replaced by a bright red glow then the fourth cylinder fell a brilliant green meteor as i learned afterwards in bushey {

of guns being laid for them unseen a fresh canister of the black vapour was discharged and where the guns were openly displayed the heat ray was brought to bear by midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of richmond park and the glare of kingston hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke blotting out the whole valley of the thames and extending as far as the eye could reach and through this two martians slowly waded and turned their hissing steam jets this way and that they were sparing of the heat ray that night either because they had but a limited supply of material for its production or because they did not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe the opposition they had aroused in the latter aim they certainly succeeded sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to their movements after that no body of men would stand against them so hopeless was the enterprise even the crews of the torpedo boats and destroyers that had brought their quick firers up the thames refused to stop mutinied and went down again the only offensive operation men ventured upon after that night was the preparation of mines and pitfalls and even in that their energies were frantic and spasmodic one has to imagine as well as one may the fate of those batteries towards esher waiting so tensely in the twilight survivors there were none one may picture the orderly expectation the officers alert and watchful the gunners ready the ammunition piled to hand the limber gunners with their horses and waggons the groups of civilian spectators standing as near as they were permitted the evening stillness the ambulances and hospital tents with the burned and wounded from weybridge then the dull resonance of the shots the martians fired and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and houses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields one may picture too the sudden shifting of the attention the swiftly spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing headlong towering heavenward turning the twilight to a palpable darkness a strange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding upon its victims men and horses near it seen dimly running shrieking falling headlong shouts of dismay the guns suddenly abandoned men choking and writhing on the ground and the swift broadening out of the opaque cone of smoke and then night and extinction nothing but a silent mass of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of richmond and the disintegrating organism of government was with a last expiring effort rousing the population of london to the necessity of flight chapter sixteen the exodus from london so you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the greatest city in the world just as monday was dawning the stream of flight rising swiftly to a torrent lashing in a foaming tumult round the railway stations banked up into a horrible struggle about the shipping in the thames and hurrying by every available channel northward and eastward by ten o clock the police organisation {

cutting off all escape over the bridges in its sluggish advance another bank drove over ealing and surrounded a little island of survivors on castle hill alive but unable to escape after a fruitless struggle to get aboard a north western train at chalk farm the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods yard there ploughed through shrieking people and a dozen stalwart men fought to keep the crowd from crushing the driver against his furnace my brother emerged upon the chalk farm road dodged across through a hurrying swarm of vehicles and had the luck to be foremost in the sack of a cycle shop the front tire of the machine he got was punctured in dragging it through the window but he got up and off notwithstanding with no further injury than a cut wrist the steep foot of haverstock {

road reached edgware about seven fasting and wearied but well ahead of the crowd along the road people were standing in the roadway curious wondering he was passed by a number of cyclists some horsemen and two motor cars a mile from edgware the rim of the wheel broke and the machine became unridable he left it by the roadside and trudged through the village there were shops half opened in the main street of the place and people crowded on the pavement and in the doorways and windows staring astonished at this extraordinary procession of fugitives that was beginning he succeeded in getting some food at an inn for a time he remained in edgware not knowing what next to do the flying people increased in number many of them like my brother seemed inclined to loiter in the place there was no fresh news of the invaders from mars at that time the road was crowded but as yet far from congested most of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles but there were soon motor cars hansom cabs and carriages hurrying along and the dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to st albans {

he happened upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers he came upon them just in time to save them he heard their screams and hurrying round the corner saw a couple of men struggling to drag them out of the little pony chaise in which they had been driving while a third with difficulty held the frightened pony s head one of the ladies a short woman dressed in white was simply screaming the other a dark slender figure slashed at the man who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her disengaged hand my brother immediately grasped the situation shouted and hurried towards the struggle one of the men desisted and turned towards him and my brother realising from his antagonist s face that a fight was unavoidable {

and being an expert boxer went into him forthwith and sent him down against the wheel of the chaise it was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet with a kick and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the slender lady s arm he heard the clatter of hoofs the whip stung across his face a third antagonist struck him between the eyes and the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in the direction from which he had come partly stunned he found himself facing the man who had held the horse s head and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the lane swaying from side to side and with the women in it looking back the man before him a burly rough tried to close and he stopped him with a blow in the face then realising that he was deserted he dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise with the sturdy man close behind him and the fugitive who had turned now following remotely suddenly he stumbled and fell his immediate pursuer went headlong and he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again he would have had little chance against them had not the slender lady very pluckily pulled up and returned to his help it seems she had had a revolver all this time but it had been under the seat when she and her companion were attacked she fired at six yards distance narrowly missing my brother the less courageous of the robbers made off and his companion followed him cursing his cowardice they both stopped in sight down the lane where the third man lay insensible take this said the slender lady and she gave my brother her revolver go back to the chaise said my brother wiping the blood from his split lip she turned without a word they were both panting and they went back to where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened pony the robbers had evidently had enough of it when my brother looked again they were retreating i ll {

who had come in the small hours from a dangerous case at pinner and heard at some railway station on his way of the martian advance he had hurried home roused the women their servant had left them two days before packed some provisions put his revolver under the seat luckily for my brother and told them to drive on to edgware with the idea of getting a train there he stopped behind to tell the neighbours he would overtake them he said at about half past four in the morning and now it was nearly nine and they had seen nothing of him they could not stop in edgware because of the growing traffic through the place and so they had come into this side lane that was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently they stopped again nearer to new barnet he promised to stay with them at least until they could determine what to do or until the missing man arrived and professed to be an expert shot with the revolver a weapon strange to him in order to give them confidence they made a sort of encampment by the wayside and the pony became happy in the hedge he told them of his own escape out of london and all that he knew of these martians and their ways the sun crept higher in the sky and after a time their talk died out and gave place to an uneasy state of anticipation {

eter nity came echoing down the road there were sad haggard women tramping by well dressed with children that cried and stumbled their dainty clothes smothered in dust their weary faces smeared with tears with many of these came men sometimes helpful sometimes lowering and savage fighting side by side with them pushed some weary street outcast in faded black rags wide eyed loud voiced and foul mouthed there were sturdy workmen thrusting their way along wretched unkempt men clothed like clerks or shopmen struggling spasmodically {

a wounded soldier my brother noticed men dressed in the clothes of railway porters one wretched creature in a nightshirt with a coat thrown over it but varied as its composition was certain things all that host had in common there were fear and pain on their faces and fear behind them a tumult up the road a quarrel for a place in a waggon sent the whole host of them quickening their pace even a man so scared and broken that his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into renewed activity the heat and dust had already been at work upon this multitude their skins were dry their lips black and cracked they were all thirsty weary and footsore and amid the various cries one heard disputes reproaches groans of weariness and fatigue the voices of most of them were hoarse and weak through it all ran a refrain way way the martians are coming few stopped and came aside from that flood the lane opened slantingly into the main road with a narrow opening and had a delusive appearance of coming from the direction of london yet a kind of eddy of people drove into its mouth weaklings elbowed out of the stream who for the most part rested but a moment before plunging into it again a little way down the lane with two friends bending over him lay a man with a bare leg wrapped about with bloody rags he was a lucky man to have friends a little old man with a grey military moustache and a filthy black frock coat limped out and sat down beside the trap removed his boot his sock was blood stained shook out a pebble and hobbled on again and then a little girl of eight or nine all alone threw herself under the hedge close by my brother weeping i can t go on i can t go on my brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up speaking gently to her and carried her to miss elphinstone so soon as my brother touched her she became quite still as if frightened ellen {

shrieked a woman in the crowd with tears in her voice ellen and the child suddenly darted away from my brother crying mother they are coming said a man on horseback riding past along the lane out of the way there bawled a coachman towering high and my brother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane the people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse my brother pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge and the man drove by and stopped at the turn of the way it was a carriage with a pole for a pair of horses but only one was in the traces my brother saw dimly through the dust that two men lifted out something on a white stretcher and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet hedge one of the men came running to my brother where is there any water he said he is dying fast and very thirsty it is lord garrick {

lord garrick said my brother the chief justice the water he said there may be a tap said my brother in some of the houses we have no water i dare not leave my people the man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner house go on said the people thrusting at him they are coming go on then my brother s attention was distracted by a bearded eagle faced man lugging a small handbag which split even as my brother s eyes rested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed to break up into separate coins as it struck the ground they rolled hither and thither among the struggling feet of men and horses the man stopped and looked stupidly at the heap and the shaft of a cab struck his shoulder and sent him reeling he gave a shriek and dodged back and a cartwheel shaved him narrowly way cried the men all about him make way so soon as the cab had passed he flung himself with both hands open upon the heap of coins and began thrusting handfuls in his pocket a horse rose close upon him and in another moment half rising he had been borne down under the horse s hoofs stop screamed my brother and pushing a woman out of his way tried to clutch the bit of the horse before he could get to it he heard a scream under the wheels and saw through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch s back the driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother who ran round behind the cart the multitudinous {

shouting confused his ears the man was writhing in the dust among his scattered money unable to rise for the wheel had broken his back and his lower limbs lay limp and dead my brother stood up and yelled at the next driver and a man on a black horse came to his assistance get him out of the road said he and clutching the man s collar with his free hand my brother lugged him sideways but he still clutched after his money and regarded my brother fiercely hammering at his arm with a handful of gold go on go on shouted angry voices behind way way there was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart that the man on horseback stopped my brother looked up and the man with the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his collar there was a concussion and the black horse came staggering sideways and the carthorse {

pushed beside it a hoof missed my brother s foot by a hair s breadth he released his grip on the fallen man and jumped back he saw anger change to terror on the face of the poor wretch on the ground and in a moment he was hidden and my brother was borne backward and carried past the entrance of the lane and had to fight hard in the torrent to recover it he saw miss elphinstone covering her eyes and a little child with all a child s want of sympathetic {

imagination staring with dilated eyes at a dusty something that lay black and still ground and crushed under the rolling wheels let us go back he shouted and began turning the pony round we cannot cross this hell he said and they went back a hundred yards the way they had come until the fighting crowd was hidden as they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw the face of the dying man in the ditch under the privet deadly white and drawn and shining with perspiration the two women sat silent crouching in their seat and shivering then beyond the bend my brother stopped again miss elphinstone was white and pale and her sister in law sat weeping too wretched even to call upon george my brother was horrified and perplexed so soon as they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to attempt this crossing he turned to miss elphinstone suddenly resolute we must go that way he said and led the pony round again for the second time that day this girl proved her quality to force their way into the torrent of people my brother plunged into the traffic and held back a cab horse while she drove the pony across its head a waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter from the chaise in another moment they were caught and swept forward by the stream my brother with the cabman s whip marks red across his face and hands scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from her point the revolver at the man behind he said giving it to her if he presses us too hard no point it at his horse then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right across the road but once in the stream he seemed to lose volition to become a part of that dusty rout they swept through chipping barnet with the torrent they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of the town before they had fought across to the opposite side of the way it was din and confusion indescribable but in and beyond the town the road forks repeatedly and this to some extent relieved the stress they struck eastward through hadley {

and there on either side of the road and at another place farther on they came upon a great multitude of people drinking at the stream some fighting to come at the water and farther on from a lull near east barnet they saw two trains running slowly one after the other without signal or order trains swarming with people with men even among the coals behind the engines going northward along the great northern railway my brother supposes they must have filled outside london for at that time the furious terror of the people had rendered the central termini impossible near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon for the violence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them they began to suffer the beginnings of hunger the night was cold and none of them dared to sleep and in the evening many people came hurrying along the road nearby {

each black splash grew and spread shooting out ramifications this way and that now banking itself against rising ground now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new found valley exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper and beyond over the blue hills that rise southward of the river the glittering martians went to and fro calmly and methodically spreading their poison cloud over this patch of country and then over that laying it again with their steam jets when it had served its purpose and taking possession of the conquered country they do not seem to have aimed at extermination so much as at complete demoralisation and the destruction of any opposition they exploded any stores of powder they came upon cut every telegraph and wrecked the railways here and there they were hamstringing {

about a couple of miles out lay an ironclad very low in the water almost to my brother s perception like a water logged ship this was the ram thunder child it was the only warship in sight but far away to the right over the smooth surface of the sea for that day there was a dead calm lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next ironclads of the channel fleet which hovered in an extended line steam up and ready for action across the thames estuary during the course of the martian conquest vigilant and yet powerless to prevent it at the sight of the sea mrs elphinstone in spite of the assurances of her sister in law gave way to panic she had never been out of england before she would rather die than trust herself friendless in a foreign country and so forth she seemed poor woman to imagine that the french and the martians might prove very similar she had been growing increasingly {

her great idea was to return to stanmore things had been always well and safe at stanmore they would find george at stanmore it was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the beach where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the attention of some men on a paddle steamer from the thames they sent a boat and drove a bargain for thirty six pounds for the three the steamer was going these men said to ostend {

it was about two o clock when my brother having paid their fares at the gangway found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his charges there was food aboard albeit at exorbitant prices and the three of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward there were already a couple of score of passengers aboard some of whom had expended their last money in securing a passage but the captain lay off the blackwater until five in the afternoon picking up passengers until the seated decks were even dangerously {

crowded he would probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of guns that began about that hour in the south as if in answer the ironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags a jet of smoke sprang out of her funnels some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from shoeburyness until it was noticed that it was growing louder at the same time far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks { 	
paperwork:2 superpower:0 underwork:-1 underworks:2 }

of three ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea beneath clouds of black smoke but my brother s attention speedily reverted to the distant firing in the south he fancied he saw a column of smoke rising out of the distant grey haze the little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big crescent of shipping and the low essex coast was growing blue and hazy when a martian appeared small and faint in the remote distance advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of foulness at that the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear and anger at his own delay and the paddles seemed infected with his terror every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of the steamer and stared at that distant shape higher than the trees or church towers inland and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human stride it was the first martian my brother had seen and he stood more amazed than terrified watching this titan advancing deliberately towards the shipping wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell away then far away beyond the crouch came another striding over some stunted trees and then yet another still farther off wading deeply through a shiny mudflat {

that seemed to hang halfway up between sea and sky they were all stalking seaward as if to intercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between foulness and the naze in spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines of the little paddle boat and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind her she receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance glancing northwestward {

my brother saw the large crescent of shipping already writhing with the approaching terror one ship passing behind another another coming round from broadside to end on steamships whistling and giving off volumes of steam sails being let out launches rushing hither and thither he was so fascinated by this and by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes for anything seaward and then a swift movement of the steamboat she had suddenly come round to avoid being run down flung him headlong from the seat upon which he was standing there was a shouting all about him a trampling of feet and a cheer that seemed to be answered faintly the steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands he sprang to his feet and saw to starboard and not a hundred yards from their heeling pitching boat a vast iron bulk like the blade of a plough tearing through the water tossing it on either side in huge waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer flinging her paddles helplessly in the air and then sucking her deck down almost to the waterline {

a douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment when his eyes were clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing landward big iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure and from that twin funnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot with fire it was the torpedo ram thunder child steaming headlong coming to the rescue of the threatened shipping keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks my brother looked past this charging leviathan at the martians again and he saw the three of them now close together and standing so far out to sea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged thus sunken and seen in remote perspective {

they appeared far less formidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was pitching so helplessly it would seem they were regarding this new antagonist with astonishment to their intelligence it may be the giant was even such another as themselves the thunder child fired no gun but simply drove full speed towards them it was probably her not firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did they did not know what to make of her one shell and they would have sent her to the bottom forthwith with the heat ray she was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway between the steamboat and the martians a diminishing {

black bulk against the receding horizontal expanse of the essex coast suddenly the foremost martian lowered his tube and discharged a canister of the black gas at the ironclad it hit her larboard side and glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward an unfolding torrent of black smoke from which the ironclad drove clear to the watchers from the steamer low in the water and with the sun in their eyes it seemed as though she were already among the martians they saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water as they retreated shoreward and one of them raised the camera like generator of the heat ray he held it pointing obliquely downward and a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch it must have driven through the iron of the ship s side like a white hot iron rod through paper a flicker of flame went up through the rising steam and then the martian reeled and staggered in another moment he was cut down and a great body of water and steam shot high in the air the guns of the thunder child sounded through the reek going off one after the other and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer ricocheted towards the other flying ships to the north and smashed a smack to matchwood but no one heeded that very much at the sight of the martian s collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately and all the crowding passengers on the steamer s stern shouted together and then they yelled again for surging out beyond the white tumult drove something long and black the flames streaming from its middle parts its ventilators {

and funnels spouting fire she was alive still the steering gear it seems was intact and her engines working she headed straight for a second martian and was within a hundred yards of him when the heat ray came to bear then with a violent thud a blinding flash her decks her funnels leaped upward the martian staggered with the violence of her explosion and in another moment the flaming wreckage still driving forward with the impetus of its pace had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing of cardboard my brother shouted involuntarily a boiling tumult of steam hid everything again two yelled the captain everyone was shouting the whole steamer from end to end rang with frantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the crowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea the steam hung upon the water for many minutes hiding the third martian and the coast altogether and all this time the boat was paddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight and when at last the confusion cleared the drifting bank of black vapour intervened and nothing of the thunder child could be made out nor could the third martian be seen but the ironclads to seaward were now quite close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat the little vessel continued to beat its way seaward and the ironclads receded slowly towards the coast which was hidden still by a marbled bank of vapour part steam part black gas eddying and combining in the strangest way the fleet of refugees was scattering to the northeast {

several smacks were sailing between the ironclads and the steamboat after a time and before they reached the sinking cloud bank the warships turned northward and then abruptly went about and passed into the thickening haze of evening southward the coast grew faint and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of clouds that were gathering about the sinking sun then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration of guns and a form of black shadows moving everyone struggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west but nothing was to be distinguished {

clearly a mass of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of the sun the steamboat throbbed on its way through an interminable suspense the sun sank into grey clouds the sky flushed and darkened the evening star trembled into sight it was deep twilight when the captain cried out and pointed my brother strained his eyes something rushed up into the sky out of the greyness rushed slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western sky something flat and broad and very large that swept round in a vast curve grew smaller sank slowly and vanished again into the grey mystery of the night and as it flew it rained down darkness upon the land book two the earth under the martians chapter one under foot in the first book i have wandered so much from my own adventures to tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two chapters i and the curate have been lurking in the empty house at halliford whither we fled to escape the black smoke there i will resume we stopped there all sunday night and all the next day the day of the panic in a little island of daylight cut off by the black smoke from the rest of the world we could do nothing but wait in aching inactivity during those two weary days my mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife i figured her at leatherhead terrified in danger mourning me already as a dead man i paced the rooms and cried aloud when i thought of how i was cut off from her of all that might happen to her in my absence my cousin i knew was brave enough for any emergency but he was not the sort of man to realise danger quickly to rise promptly what was needed now was not bravery but circumspection my only consolation was to believe that the martians were moving london ward and away from her such vague anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful i grew very weary and irritable with the curate s perpetual ejaculations {

i tired of the sight of his selfish despair after some ineffectual remonstrance i kept away from him staying in a room evidently a children s schoolroom containing globes forms and copybooks when he followed me thither i went to a box room at the top of the house and in order to be alone with my aching miseries locked myself in we were hopelessly hemmed in by the black smoke all that day and the morning of the next there were signs of people in the next house on sunday evening a face at a window and moving lights and later the slamming of a door but i do not know who these people were nor what became of them we saw nothing of them next day the black smoke drifted slowly riverward {

all through monday morning creeping nearer and nearer to us driving at last along the roadway outside the house that hid us a martian came across the fields about midday laying the stuff with a jet of superheated {

steam that hissed against the walls smashed all the windows it touched and scalded the curate s hand as he fled out of the front room when at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked out again the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had passed over it looking towards the river we were astonished to see an unaccountable redness mingling with the black of the scorched meadows for a time we did not see how this change affected our position save that we were relieved of our fear of the black smoke but later i perceived that we were no longer hemmed in that now we might get away so soon as i realised that the way of escape was open my dream of action returned but the curate was lethargic unreasonable {

we are safe here he repeated safe here i resolved to leave him would that i had wiser now for the artilleryman s teaching i sought out food and drink i had found oil and rags for my burns and i also took a hat and a flannel shirt that i found in one of the bedrooms when it was clear to him that i meant to go alone had reconciled myself to going alone he suddenly roused himself to come and all being quiet throughout the afternoon we started about five o clock as i should judge along the blackened road to sunbury in sunbury and at intervals along the road were dead bodies lying in contorted attitudes horses as well as men overturned carts and luggage all covered thickly with black dust that pall of cindery powder made me think of what i had read of the destruction of pompeii {

these were the first people we saw away across the road the woods beyond ham and petersham were still afire twickenham was uninjured by either heat ray or black smoke and there were more people about here though none could give us news for the most part they were like ourselves taking advantage of a lull to shift their quarters i have an impression that many of the houses here were still occupied by scared inhabitants too frightened even for flight here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along the road i remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap pounded into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts we crossed richmond bridge about half past eight we hurried across the exposed bridge of course but i noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses some many feet across i did not know what these were there was no time for scrutiny and i put a more horrible interpretation {

on them than they deserved here again on the surrey side were black dust that had once been smoke and dead bodies a heap near the approach to the station but we had no glimpse of the martians until we were some way towards barnes we saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running down a side street towards the river but otherwise it seemed deserted up the hill richmond town was burning briskly outside the town of richmond there was no trace of the black smoke then suddenly as we approached kew came a number of people running and the upperworks of a martian fighting machine loomed in sight over the housetops not a hundred yards away from us we stood aghast at our danger and had the martian looked down we must immediately have perished we were so terrified that we dared not go on but turned aside and hid in a shed in a garden there the curate crouched weeping silently and refusing to stir again but my fixed idea of reaching leatherhead would not let me rest and in the twilight i ventured out again i went through a shrubbery and along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds and so emerged upon the road towards kew the curate i left in the shed but he came hurrying after me that second start was the most foolhardy thing i ever did for it was manifest the martians were about us no sooner had the curate overtaken me than we saw either the fighting machine we had seen before or another far away across the meadows in the direction of kew lodge four or five little black figures hurried before it across the green grey of the field and in a moment it was evident this martian pursued them in three strides he was among them and they ran radiating from his feet in all directions he used no heat ray to destroy them but picked them up one by one apparently he tossed them into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him much as a workman s basket hangs over his shoulder it was the first time i realised that the martians might have any other purpose than destruction with defeated humanity we stood for a moment petrified then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a walled garden fell into rather than found a fortunate ditch and lay there scarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars were out i suppose it was nearly eleven o clock before we gathered courage to start again no longer venturing into the road but sneaking along hedgerows and through plantations {

and watching keenly through the darkness he on the right and i on the left for the martians who seemed to be all about us in one place we blundered upon a scorched and blackened area now cooling and ashen and a number of scattered dead bodies of men burned horribly about the heads and trunks but with their legs and boots mostly intact and of dead horses fifty feet perhaps behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages sheen it seemed had escaped destruction but the place was silent and deserted here we happened on no dead though the night was too dark for us to see into the side roads of the place in sheen my companion suddenly complained of faintness and thirst and we decided to try one of the houses the first house we entered after a little difficulty with the window was a small semi detached villa and i found nothing eatable left in the place but some mouldy cheese there was however water to drink and i took a hatchet which promised to be useful in our next house breaking we then crossed to a place where the road turns towards mortlake {

here there stood a white house within a walled garden and in the pantry of this domicile we found a store of food two loaves of bread in a pan an uncooked steak and the half of a ham i give this catalogue so precisely because as it happened we were destined to subsist upon this store for the next fortnight bottled beer stood under a shelf and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp lettuces this pantry opened into a kind of wash up kitchen and in this was firewood there was also a cupboard in which we found nearly a dozen of burgundy tinned soups and salmon and two tins of biscuits we sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark for we dared not strike a light and ate bread and ham and drank beer out of the same bottle the curate who was still timorous and restless was now oddly enough for pushing on and i was urging him to keep up his strength by eating when the thing happened that was to imprison us it can t be midnight yet i said and then came a blinding glare of vivid green light everything in the kitchen leaped out clearly visible in green and black and vanished again and then followed such a concussion as i have never heard before or since so close on the heels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me a clash of glass a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us and the plaster of the ceiling came down upon us smashing into a multitude of fragments upon our heads i was knocked headlong across the floor against the oven handle and stunned i was insensible for a long time the curate told me and when i came to we were in darkness again and he with a face wet as i found afterwards with blood from a cut forehead was dabbing water over me for some time i could not recollect what had happened then things came to me slowly a bruise on my temple asserted itself are you better asked the curate in a whisper at last i answered him i sat up don t move he said the floor is covered with smashed crockery from the dresser you can t possibly move without making a noise and i fancy they are outside we both sat quite silent so that we could scarcely hear each other breathing everything seemed deadly still but once something near us some plaster or broken brickwork slid down with a rumbling sound outside and very near was an intermittent metallic rattle that said the curate when presently it happened again yes i said but what is it a martian said the curate i listened again it was not like the heat ray i said and for a time i was inclined to think one of the great fighting machines had stumbled against the house as i had seen one stumble against the tower of shepperton church our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or four hours until the dawn came we scarcely moved and then the light filtered in not through the window which remained black but through a triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in the wall behind us the interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for the first time the window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould which flowed over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet outside the soil was banked high against the house at the top of the window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe {

fluttering from the walls above the kitchen range as the dawn grew clearer we saw through the gap in the wall the body of a martian standing sentinel i suppose over the still glowing cylinder at the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as possible out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the scullery abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind the fifth cylinder i whispered the fifth shot from mars has struck this house and buried us under the ruins for a time the curate was silent and then he whispered god have mercy upon us i heard him presently whimpering to himself save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery i for my part scarce dared breathe and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint light of the kitchen door i could just see the curate s face a dim oval shape and his collar and cuffs outside there began a metallic hammering then a violent hooting and then again after a quiet interval a hissing like the hissing of an engine these noises for the most part problematical continued intermittently and seemed if anything to increase in number as time wore on presently a measured thudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the vessels in the pantry ring and shift began and continued once the light was eclipsed and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely dark for many hours we must have crouched there silent and shivering until our tired attention failed at last i found myself awake and very hungry i am inclined to believe we must have spent the greater portion of a day before that awakening my hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me to action i told the curate i was going to seek food and felt my way towards the pantry he made me no answer but so soon as i began eating the faint noise i made stirred him up and i heard him crawling after me chapter two what we saw from the ruined house after eating we crept back to the scullery and there i must have dozed again for when presently i looked round i was alone the thudding vibration continued with wearisome persistence {

i whispered for the curate several times and at last felt my way to the door of the kitchen it was still daylight and i perceived him across the room lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the martians his shoulders were hunched so that his head was hidden from me i could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine shed and the place rocked with that beating thud through the aperture in the wall i could see the top of a tree touched with gold and the warm blue of a tranquil evening sky for a minute or so i remained watching the curate and then i advanced crouching and stepping with extreme care amid the broken crockery that littered the floor i touched the curate s leg and he started so violently that a mass of plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact i gripped his arm fearing he might cry out and for a long time we crouched motionless then i turned to see how much of our rampart remained the detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open in the debris and by raising myself cautiously across a beam i was able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet suburban roadway vast indeed was the change that we beheld the fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the house we had first visited the building had vanished completely smashed pulverised and dispersed by the blow the cylinder lay now far beneath the original foundations {

deep in a hole already vastly larger than the pit i had looked into at woking the earth all round it had splashed under that tremendous impact splashed is the only word and lay in heaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent houses it had behaved exactly like mud under the violent blow of a hammer our house had collapsed backward the front portion even on the ground floor had been destroyed completely by a chance the kitchen and scullery had escaped and stood buried now under soil and ruins closed in by tons of earth on every side save towards the cylinder over that aspect we hung now on the very edge of the great circular pit the martians were engaged in making the heavy beating sound was evidently just behind us and ever and again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil across our peephole {

the cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit and on the farther edge of the pit amid the smashed and gravel heaped shrubbery one of the great fighting machines deserted by its occupant stood stiff and tall against the evening sky at first i scarcely noticed the pit and the cylinder although it has been convenient to describe them first on account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism i saw busy in the excavation and on account of the strange creatures that were crawling slowly and painfully across the heaped mould near it the mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first it was one of those complicated fabrics that have since been called handling machines and the study of which has already given such an enormous impetus to terrestrial invention as it dawned upon me first it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed agile legs and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers bars and reaching and clutching tentacles about its body most of its arms were retracted but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of rods plates and bars which lined the covering and apparently strengthened { 	
strength:0 strengthen:6 strengths:-1 }

the walls of the cylinder these as it extracted them were lifted out and deposited upon a level surface of earth behind it its motion was so swift complex and perfect that at first i did not see it as a machine in spite of its metallic glitter the fighting machines were coordinated {

and animated to an extraordinary pitch but nothing to compare with this people who have never seen these structures and have only the ill imagined efforts of artists or the imperfect descriptions {

account of the war the artist had evidently made a hasty study of one of the fighting machines and there his knowledge ended he presented them as tilted stiff tripods without either flexibility {

or subtlety and with an altogether misleading monotony of effect the pamphlet containing these renderings had a considerable vogue and i mention them here simply to warn the reader against the impression they may have created they were no more like the martians i saw in action than a dutch doll is like a human being to my mind the pamphlet would have been much better without them at first i say the handling machine did not impress me as a machine but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument the controlling {

moreover i was concealed and motionless and under no urgency of action they were i now saw the most unearthly creatures it is possible to conceive they were huge round bodies or rather heads about four feet in diameter each body having in front of it a face this face had no nostrils indeed the martians do not seem to have had any sense of smell but it had a pair of very large dark coloured eyes and just beneath this a kind of fleshy beak in the back of this head or body i scarcely know how to speak of it was the single tight tympanic surface since known to be anatomically { 	
analogical:0 analytical:2 anatomic:0 anatomical:6 }

an ear though it must have been almost useless in our dense air in a group round the mouth were sixteen slender almost whiplike tentacles arranged in two bunches of eight each these bunches have since been named rather aptly by that distinguished anatomist professor howes the hands even as i saw these martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring { 	
endearing:-1 endeavor:-1 endeavour:3 endeavours:2 }

to raise themselves on these hands but of course with the increased weight of terrestrial conditions this was impossible there is reason to suppose that on mars they may have progressed upon them with some facility the internal anatomy i may remark here as dissection has since shown was almost equally simple the greater part of the structure was the brain sending enormous nerves to the eyes ear and tactile tentacles besides this were the bulky lungs into which the mouth opened and the heart and its vessels the pulmonary distress caused by the denser atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only too evident in the convulsive movements of the outer skin and this was the sum of the martian organs strange as it may seem to a human being all the complex apparatus of digestion which makes up the bulk of our bodies did not exist in the martians they were heads merely heads entrails they had none they did not eat much less digest instead they took the fresh living blood of other creatures and injected it into their own veins i have myself seen this being done as i shall mention in its place but squeamish as i may seem i cannot bring myself to describe what i could not endure even to continue watching let it suffice to say blood obtained from a still living animal in most cases from a human being was run directly by means of a little pipette into the recipient canal the bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us but at the same time i think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous {

habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit the physiological {

advantages of the practice of injection are undeniable if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and energy occasioned by eating and the digestive process our bodies are half made up of glands and tubes and organs occupied in turning heterogeneous {

food into blood the digestive processes and their reaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our minds men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy livers or sound gastric glands but the martians were lifted above all these organic fluctuations { 	
fluctuant:1 fluctuate:-1 fluctuates:1 }

of mood and emotion their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment { 	
cornishmen:2 nourish:-1 nourished:0 nourisher:0 nourishers:-1 nourishes:0 nourishing:-1 }

is partly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims they had brought with them as provisions from mars these creatures to judge from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands were bipeds with flimsy silicious skeletons almost like those of the silicious sponges and feeble musculature { 	
muscular:1 muscularly:-1 subculture:-1 }

standing about six feet high and having round erect heads and large eyes in flinty sockets two or three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder and all were killed before earth was reached it was just as well for them for the mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken every bone in their bodies and while i am engaged in this description i may add in this place certain further details which although they were not all evident to us at the time will enable the reader who is unacquainted { 	
reacquaint:-1 unacquaint:6 unactuated:-1 }

with them to form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures in three other points their physiology differed strangely from ours their organisms did not sleep any more than the heart of man sleeps since they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate that periodical extinction was unknown to them they had little or no sense of fatigue it would seem on earth they could never have moved without effort yet even to the last they kept in action in twenty four hours they did twenty four hours of work as even on earth is perhaps the case with the ants in the next place wonderful as it seems in a sexual world the martians were absolutely without sex and therefore without any of the tumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among men a young martian there can now be no dispute was really born upon earth during the war and it was found attached to its parent partially budded off just as young lilybulbs bud off or like the young animals in the fresh water polyp in man in all the higher terrestrial animals such a method of increase has disappeared { 	
deaspirate:-1 didapper:0 didappers:2 disappear:5 disappears:4 }

but even on this earth it was certainly the primitive method among the lower animals up even to those first cousins of the vertebrated {

the two processes occur side by side but finally the sexual method superseded its competitor altogether on mars however just the reverse has apparently been the case it is worthy of remark that a certain speculative {

writer of quasi scientific repute writing long before the martian invasion did forecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual martian condition his prophecy i remember appeared in november {

the pall mall budget and i recall a caricature of it in a pre martian periodical called punch he pointed out writing in a foolish facetious tone that the perfection of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs the perfection of chemical devices digestion that such organs as hair external nose teeth ears and chin were no longer essential parts of the human being and that the tendency of natural selection would lie in the direction of their steady diminution through the coming ages the brain alone remained a cardinal necessity only one other part of the body had a strong case for survival and that was the hand teacher and agent of the brain while the rest of the body dwindled the hands would grow larger there is many a true word written in jest and here in the martians we have beyond dispute the actual accomplishment {

of such a suppression { 	
soppiness:-1 superposes:-1 supersonic:0 supposers:0 supposes:-1 supposings:-1 suppress:2 suppressed:0 suppresses:0 suppressor:3 }

of the animal side of the organism by the intelligence to me it is quite credible that the martians may be descended from beings not unlike ourselves by a gradual development {

of brain and hands the latter giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last at the expense of the rest of the body without the body the brain would of course become a mere selfish intelligence without any of the emotional substratum of the human being the last salient point in which the systems of these creatures differed from ours was in what one might have thought a very trivial particular micro organisms which cause so much disease and pain on earth have either never appeared upon mars or martian sanitary science eliminated them ages ago a hundred diseases all the fevers and contagions of human life consumption {

between the life on mars and terrestrial life i may allude here to the curious suggestions {

of the red weed apparently the vegetable kingdom in mars instead of having green for a dominant colour is of a vivid blood red tint at any rate the seeds which the martians intentionally {

or accidentally { 	
accident:0 accidental:6 accidents:-1 occidental:1 }

brought with them gave rise in all cases to red coloured growths only that known popularly as the red weed however gained any footing in competition { 	
coemption:0 coemptions:-1 competent:-1 competing:0 competitor:3 completion:-1 compotier:-1 }

with terrestrial forms the red creeper was quite a transitory growth and few people have seen it growing for a time however the red weed grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance it spread up the sides of the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment { 	
imprison:0 imprisoned:1 imprisons:-1 }

and its cactus like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our triangular window and afterwards i found it broadcast throughout the country and especially wherever there was a stream of water the martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ a single round drum at the back of the head body and eyes with a visual range not very different from ours except that according to philips { 	
chilies:-1 chilis:-1 hippies:-1 philibegs:0 philippic:1 philippics:3 philippina:0 philippine:0 philistine:-1 philopenas:-1 shilpit:0 shiplap:-1 }

blue and violet were as black to them it is commonly supposed that they communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations this is asserted for instance in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet written evidently by someone not an eye witness of martian actions to which i have already alluded and which so far has been the chief source of information concerning them now no surviving human being saw so much of the martians in action as i did i take no credit to myself for an accident but the fact is so and i assert that i watched them closely time after time and that i have seen four five and once six of them sluggishly performing the most elaborately {

complicated operations together without either sound or gesture their peculiar hooting invariably preceded feeding it had no modulation and was i believe in no sense a signal but merely the expiration of air preparatory {

operation i have a certain claim to at least an elementary knowledge of psychology and in this matter i am convinced as firmly as i am convinced of anything that the martians interchanged { 	
anteceding:1 inearthing:-1 interchain:1 intergrade:-1 interregna:-1 intrenched:-1 unteaching:0 }

thoughts without any physical intermediation and i have been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions before the martian invasion as an occasional reader here or there may remember i had written with some little vehemence against the telepathic theory the martians wore no clothing their conceptions {

of ornament and decorum were necessarily different from ours and not only were they evidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are but changes of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at all seriously yet though they wore no clothing it was in the other artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great superiority { 	
superior:2 superiorly:3 superiors:1 }

over man lay we men with our bicycles and road skates our lilienthal { 	
millennial:-1 }

soaring machines our guns and sticks and so forth are just in the beginning of the evolution that the martians have worked out they have become practically mere brains wearing different bodies according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take a bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet and of their appliances perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact that what is the dominant feature of almost all human devices in mechanism is absent the wheel is absent among all the things they brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels one would have at least expected it in locomotion and in this connection it is curious to remark that even on this earth nature has never hit upon the wheel or has preferred other expedients to its development and not only did the martians either not know of which is incredible or abstain from the wheel but in their apparatus singularly little use is made of the fixed pivot or relatively fixed pivot with circular motions thereabout confined to one plane almost all the joints of the machinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving over small but beautifully { 	
beautiful:5 beautify:1 }

curved friction bearings and while upon this matter of detail it is remarkable that the long leverages of their machines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature of the disks in an elastic sheath these disks become polarised and drawn closely and powerfully together when traversed by a current of electricity { 	
electivity:0 electric:2 electrical:0 electrics:1 electrify:0 erectility:2 }

in this way the curious parallelism { 	
parallel:2 paralleled:0 parallelly:0 parallels:4 parellas:-1 }

to animal motions which was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder was attained such quasi muscles abounded in the crablike handling machine which on my first peeping out of the slit i watched unpacking the cylinder it seemed infinitely more alive than the actual martians lying beyond it in the sunset light panting stirring ineffectual tentacles and moving feebly after their vast journey across space while i was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight and noting each strange detail of their form the curate reminded me of his presence by pulling violently at my arm i turned to a scowling face and silent eloquent lips he wanted the slit which permitted only one of us to peep through and so i had to forego watching them for a time while he enjoyed that privilege when i looked again the busy handling machine had already put together several of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the cylinder into a shape having an unmistakable { 	
unmissable:-1 }

likeness to its own and down on the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view emitting jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit excavating and embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner this it was which had caused the regular beating noise and the rhythmic shocks that had kept our ruinous refuge quivering it piped and whistled as it worked so far as i could see the thing was without a directing martian at all chapter three the days of imprisonment the arrival of a second fighting machine drove us from our peephole into the scullery for we feared that from his elevation the martian might see down upon us behind our barrier at a later date we began to feel less in danger of their eyes for to an eye in the dazzle of the sunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness but at first the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery in heart throbbing retreat yet terrible as was the danger we incurred the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible and i recall now with a sort of wonder that in spite of the infinite danger in which we were between starvation and a still more terrible death we could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of sight we would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness and the dread of making a noise and strike each other and thrust and kick within a few inches of exposure the fact is that we had absolutely incompatible {

dispositions {

and habits of thought and action and our danger and isolation only accentuated {

the incompatibility at halliford i had already come to hate the curate s trick of helpless exclamation {

his stupid rigidity of mind his endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort i made to think out a line of action and drove me at times thus pent up and intensified { 	
identifies:-1 indefinite:2 infinites:-1 intensify:1 intensive:0 interdines:0 }

almost to the verge of craziness he was as lacking in restraint as a silly woman he would weep for hours together and i verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought his weak tears in some way efficacious { 	
efficacity:0 officiates:-1 }

and i would sit in the darkness unable to keep my mind off him by reason of his importunities { 	
importune:0 importuned:-1 importuner:-1 importunes:2 }

he ate more than i did and it was in vain i pointed out that our only chance of life was to stop in the house until the martians had done with their pit that in that long patience a time might presently come when we should need food he ate and drank impulsively { 	
implosive:0 impulsive:5 }

in heavy meals at long intervals he slept little as the days wore on his utter carelessness { 	
careless:0 cateresses:-1 }

of any consideration so intensified our distress and danger that i had much as i loathed doing it to resort to threats and at last to blows that brought him to reason for a time but he was one of those weak creatures void of pride timorous anaemic hateful souls full of shifty cunning who face neither god nor man who face not even themselves it is disagreeable { 	
disagree:0 disagreed:-1 disagrees:-1 }

for me to recall and write these things but i set them down that my story may lack nothing those who have escaped the dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality my flash of rage in our final tragedy easy enough to blame for they know what is wrong as well as any but not what is possible to tortured men but those who have been under the shadow who have gone down at last to elemental things will have a wider charity and while within we fought out our dark dim contest of whispers snatched food and drink and gripping hands and blows without in the pitiless sunlight of that terrible june was the strange wonder the unfamiliar routine of the martians in the pit let me return to those first new experiences of mine after a long time i ventured back to the peephole to find that the new comers had been reinforced by the occupants of no fewer than three of the fighting machines these last had brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in an orderly manner about the cylinder the second handling machine was now completed and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances { 	
concertina:0 conservant:2 conspirant:-1 container:-1 containers:1 contravene:0 contrive:-1 contrivers:0 contrives:1 conversant:1 }

the big machine had brought this was a body resembling a milk can in its general form above which oscillated a pear shaped receptacle and from which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin below the oscillatory { 	
collimator:-1 decollator:-1 oscillate:1 oscillated:0 oscillates:0 oscillator:8 osculatory:-1 }

motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of the handling machine with two spatulate hands the handling machine was digging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear shaped receptacle above while with another arm it periodically opened a door and removed rusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the machine another steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin along a ribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me by the mound of bluish dust from this unseen receiver a little thread of green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air as i looked the handling machine with a faint and musical clinking extended telescopic fashion a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere blunt projection until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay in another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight untarnished {

as yet and shining dazzlingly and deposited it in a growing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit between sunset and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a hundred such bars out of the crude clay and the mound of bluish dust rose steadily until it topped the side of the pit the contrast between the swift and complex movements of these contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters was acute and for days i had to tell myself repeatedly that these latter were indeed the living of the two things the curate had possession of the slit when the first men were brought to the pit i was sitting below huddled up listening with all my ears he made a sudden movement backward and i fearful that we were observed crouched in a spasm of terror he came sliding down the rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness inarticulate gesticulating and for a moment i shared his panic his gesture suggested a resignation { 	
designator:2 obsignate:-1 originate:-1 originates:1 rationing:-1 reasoning:-1 remigation:-1 resigning:-1 resinating:2 resonating:1 retaining:-1 }

of the slit and after a little while my curiosity gave me courage and i rose up stepped across him and clambered up to it at first i could see no reason for his frantic behaviour the twilight had now come the stars were little and faint but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that came from the aluminium making the whole picture was a flickering scheme of green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows strangely trying to the eyes over and through it all went the bats heeding it not at all the sprawling martians were no longer to be seen the mound of blue green powder had risen to cover them from sight and a fighting machine with its legs contracted crumpled and abbreviated { 	
abbreviate:8 }

stood across the corner of the pit and then amid the clangour of the machinery came a drifting suspicion of human voices that i entertained { 	
endearment:-1 enterate:-1 entertain:5 entertains:4 entertake:0 entrained:-1 entreated:-1 entreaties:-1 entreating:0 intenerate:1 }

at first only to dismiss i crouched watching this fighting machine closely satisfying myself now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a martian as the green flames lifted i could see the oily gleam of his integument and the brightness of his eyes and suddenly i heard a yell and saw a long tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the machine to the little cage that hunched upon its back then something something struggling violently was lifted high against the sky a black vague enigma against the starlight and as this black object came down again i saw by the green brightness that it was a man for an instant he was clearly visible he was a stout ruddy middle aged man well dressed three days before he must have been walking the world a man of considerable consequence { 	
consequent:4 }

i could see his staring eyes and gleams of light on his studs and watch chain he vanished behind the mound and for a moment there was silence and then began a shrieking and a sustained and cheerful hooting from the martians i slid down the rubbish struggled to my feet clapped my hands over my ears and bolted into the scullery the curate who had been crouching silently with his arms over his head looked up as i passed cried out quite loudly at my desertion of him and came running after me that night as we lurked in the scullery balanced between our horror and the terrible fascination this peeping had although i felt an urgent need of action i tried in vain to conceive some plan of escape but afterwards during the second day i was able to consider our position with great clearness the curate i found was quite incapable of discussion this new and culminating { 	
culminant:3 culminate:1 culminated:0 culminates:0 fulminant:-1 }

atrocity had robbed him of all vestiges of reason or forethought practically he had already sunk to the level of an animal but as the saying goes i gripped myself with both hands it grew upon my mind once i could face the facts that terrible as our position was there was as yet no justification for absolute despair our chief chance lay in the possibility of the martians making the pit nothing more than a temporary encampment or even if they kept it permanently { 	
germanely:-1 permanence:0 permanency:3 permanent:5 repayment:-1 }

they might not consider it necessary to guard it and a chance of escape might be afforded us i also weighed very carefully the possibility of our digging a way out in a direction away from the pit but the chances of our emerging within sight of some sentinel fighting machine seemed at first too great and i should have had to do all the digging myself the curate would certainly have failed me it was on the third day if my memory serves me right that i saw the lad killed it was the only occasion on which i actually saw the martians feed after that experience i avoided the hole in the wall for the better part of a day i went into the scullery removed the door and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as possible but when i had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the loose earth collapsed noisily and i did not dare continue i lost heart and lay down on the scullery floor for a long time having no spirit even to move and after that i abandoned altogether the idea of escaping by excavation it says much for the impression the martians had made upon me that at first i entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought about by their overthrow through any human effort but on the fourth or fifth night i heard a sound like heavy guns it was very late in the night and the moon was shining brightly the martians had taken away the excavating machine and save for a fighting machine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit and a handling machine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of the pit immediately beneath my peephole the place was deserted by them except for the pale glow from the handling machine and the bars and patches of white moonlight the pit was in darkness and except for the clinking of the handling machine quite still that night was a beautiful serenity save for one planet the moon seemed to have the sky to herself i heard a dog howling and that familiar sound it was that made me listen then i heard quite distinctly a booming exactly like the sound of great guns six distinct reports i counted and after a long interval six again and that was all chapter four the death of the curate it was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that i peeped for the last time and presently found myself alone instead of keeping close to me and trying to oust me from the slit the curate had gone back into the scullery i was struck by a sudden thought i went back quickly and quietly into the scullery in the darkness i heard the curate drinking i snatched in the darkness and my fingers caught a bottle of burgundy for a few minutes there was a tussle the bottle struck the floor and broke and i desisted and rose we stood panting and threatening { 	
threading:-1 threaping:-1 threaten:2 threatened:0 threatener:0 threatens:1 threating:3 }

each other in the end i planted myself between him and the food and told him of my determination to begin a discipline i divided the food in the pantry into rations to last us ten days i would not let him eat any more that day in the afternoon he made a feeble effort to get at the food i had been dozing but in an instant i was awake all day and all night we sat face to face i weary but resolute and he weeping and complaining of his immediate hunger it was i know a night and a day but to me it seemed it seems now an interminable length of time and so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict for two vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests there were times when i beat and kicked him madly times when i cajoled and persuaded him and once i tried to bribe him with the last bottle of burgundy for there was a rain water pump from which i could get water but neither force nor kindness availed he was indeed beyond reason he would neither desist from his attacks on the food nor from his noisy babbling to himself the rudimentary {

to keep our imprisonment endurable he would not observe slowly i began to realise the complete overthrow of his intelligence to perceive that my sole companion in this close and sickly darkness was a man insane from certain vague memories i am inclined to think my own mind wandered at times i had strange and hideous dreams whenever i slept it sounds paradoxical {

but i am inclined to think that the weakness and insanity of the curate warned me braced me and kept me a sane man on the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering and nothing i could do would moderate his speech it is just o god he would say over and over again it is just on me and mine be the punishment laid we have sinned we have fallen short there was poverty sorrow the poor were trodden in the dust and i held my peace i preached acceptable folly my god what folly when i should have stood up though i died for it and called upon them to repent repent oppressors of the poor and needy the wine press of god then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food i withheld from him praying begging weeping at last threatening he began to raise his voice i prayed him not to he perceived a hold on me he threatened he would shout and bring the martians upon us for a time that scared me but any concession would have shortened our chance of escape beyond estimating i defied him although i felt no assurance that he might not do this thing but that day at any rate he did not he talked with his voice rising slowly through the greater part of the eighth and ninth days threats entreaties mingled with a torrent of half sane and always frothy repentance for his vacant sham of god s service such as made me pity him then he slept awhile and began again with renewed strength so loudly that i must needs make him desist be still i implored he rose to his knees for he had been sitting in the darkness near the copper i have been still too long he said in a tone that must have reached the pit and now i must bear my witness woe unto this unfaithful city woe woe woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet shut up i said rising to my feet and in a terror lest the martians should hear us for god s sake nay shouted the curate at the top of his voice standing likewise and extending his arms speak the word of the lord is upon me in three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen i must bear my witness i go it has already been too long delayed i put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall in a flash i was after him i was fierce with fear before he was halfway across the kitchen i had overtaken him with one last touch of humanity i turned the blade back and struck him with the butt he went headlong forward and lay stretched on the ground i stumbled over him and stood panting he lay still suddenly i heard a noise without the run and smash of slipping plaster and the triangular aperture in the wall was darkened i looked up and saw the lower surface of a handling machine coming slowly across the hole one of its gripping limbs curled amid the debris another limb appeared feeling its way over the fallen beams i stood petrified staring then i saw through a sort of glass plate near the edge of the body the face as we may call it and the large dark eyes of a martian peering and then a long metallic snake of tentacle came feeling slowly through the hole i turned by an effort stumbled over the curate and stopped at the scullery door the tentacle was now some way two yards or more in the room and twisting and turning with queer sudden movements this way and that for a while i stood fascinated by that slow fitful advance then with a faint hoarse cry i forced myself across the scullery i trembled violently i could scarcely stand upright i opened the door of the coal cellar and stood there in the darkness staring at the faintly lit doorway into the kitchen and listening had the martian seen me what was it doing now something was moving to and fro there very quietly every now and then it tapped against the wall or started on its movements with a faint metallic ringing like the movements of keys on a split ring then a heavy body i knew too well what was dragged across the floor of the kitchen towards the opening irresistibly attracted i crept to the door and peeped into the kitchen in the triangle of bright outer sunlight i saw the martian in its briareus {

the curate s head i thought at once that it would infer my presence from the mark of the blow i had given him i crept back to the coal cellar shut the door and began to cover myself up as much as i could and as noiselessly as possible in the darkness among the firewood and coal therein every now and then i paused rigid to hear if the martian had thrust its tentacles through the opening again then the faint metallic jingle returned i traced it slowly feeling over the kitchen presently i heard it nearer in the scullery as i judged i thought that its length might be insufficient to reach me i prayed copiously it passed scraping faintly across the cellar door an age of almost intolerable { 	
intolerant:0 }

suspense intervened then i heard it fumbling at the latch it had found the door the martians understood doors it worried at the catch for a minute perhaps and then the door opened in the darkness i could just see the thing like an elephant s trunk more than anything else waving towards me and touching and examining the wall coals wood and ceiling it was like a black worm swaying its blind head to and fro once even it touched the heel of my boot i was on the verge of screaming i bit my hand for a time the tentacle was silent i could have fancied it had been withdrawn presently with an abrupt click it gripped something i thought it had me and seemed to go out of the cellar again for a minute i was not sure apparently it had taken a lump of coal to examine i seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position which had become cramped and then listened i whispered passionate prayers for safety then i heard the slow deliberate sound creeping towards me again slowly slowly it drew near scratching against the walls and tapping the furniture while i was still doubtful it rapped smartly against the cellar door and closed it i heard it go into the pantry and the biscuit tins rattled and a bottle smashed and then came a heavy bump against the cellar door then silence that passed into an infinity of suspense had it gone at last i decided that it had it came into the scullery no more but i lay all the tenth day in the close darkness buried among coals and firewood not daring even to crawl out for the drink for which i craved it was the eleventh day before i ventured so far from my security chapter five the stillness my first act before i went into the pantry was to fasten the door between the kitchen and the scullery but the pantry was empty every scrap of food had gone apparently the martian had taken it all on the previous day at that discovery i despaired for the first time i took no food or no drink either on the eleventh or the twelfth day at first my mouth and throat were parched and my strength ebbed sensibly i sat about in the darkness of the scullery in a state of despondent wretchedness my mind ran on eating i thought i had become deaf for the noises of movement i had been accustomed to hear from the pit had ceased absolutely i did not feel strong enough to crawl noiselessly to the peephole or i would have gone there on the twelfth day my throat was so painful that taking the chance of alarming the martians i attacked the creaking rain water pump that stood by the sink and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and tainted rain water i was greatly refreshed by this and emboldened by the fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my pumping during these days in a rambling inconclusive way i thought much of the curate and of the manner of his death on the thirteenth day i drank some more water and dozed and thought disjointedly { 	
disjoined:1 disjoint:0 disjointed:6 disjoints:-1 }

of eating and of vague impossible plans of escape whenever i dozed i dreamt of horrible phantasms of the death of the curate or of sumptuous dinners but asleep or awake i felt a keen pain that urged me to drink again and again the light that came into the scullery was no longer grey but red to my disordered imagination it seemed the colour of blood on the fourteenth day i went into the kitchen and i was surprised to find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across the hole in the wall turning the half light of the place into a crimson coloured obscurity it was early on the fifteenth day that i heard a curious familiar sequence of sounds in the kitchen and listening identified it as the snuffing and scratching of a dog going into the kitchen i saw a dog s nose peering in through a break among the ruddy fronds this greatly surprised me at the scent of me he barked shortly i thought if i could induce him to come into the place quietly i should be able perhaps to kill and eat him and in any case it would be advisable to kill him lest his actions attracted the attention of the martians i crept forward saying good dog very softly but he suddenly withdrew his head and disappeared i listened i was not deaf but certainly the pit was still i heard a sound like the flutter of a bird s wings and a hoarse croaking but that was all for a long while i lay close to the peephole but not daring to move aside the red plants that obscured it once or twice i heard a faint pitter patter like the feet of the dog going hither and thither on the sand far below me and there were more birdlike sounds but that was all at length encouraged by the silence i looked out except in the corner where a multitude of crows hopped and fought over the skeletons of the dead the martians had consumed there was not a living thing in the pit i stared about me scarcely believing my eyes all the machinery had gone save for the big mound of greyish blue powder in one corner certain bars of aluminium in another the black birds and the skeletons of the killed the place was merely an empty circular pit in the sand slowly i thrust myself out through the red weed and stood upon the mound of rubble i could see in any direction save behind me to the north and neither martians nor sign of martians were to be seen the pit dropped sheerly from my feet but a little way along the rubbish afforded a practicable {

slope to the summit of the ruins my chance of escape had come i began to tremble i hesitated for some time and then in a gust of desperate resolution and with a heart that throbbed violently i scrambled to the top of the mound in which i had been buried so long i looked about again to the northward too no martian was visible when i had last seen this part of sheen in the daylight it had been a straggling street of comfortable {

white and red houses interspersed {

with abundant shady trees now i stood on a mound of smashed brickwork clay and gravel over which spread a multitude of red cactus shaped plants knee high without a solitary terrestrial growth to dispute their footing the trees near me were dead and brown but further a network of red thread scaled the still living stems the neighbouring houses had all been wrecked but none had been burned their walls stood sometimes to the second story with smashed windows and shattered doors the red weed grew tumultuously in their roofless rooms below me was the great pit with the crows struggling for its refuse a number of other birds hopped about among the ruins far away i saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly {

along a wall but traces of men there were none the day seemed by contrast with my recent confinement {

dazzlingly bright the sky a glowing blue a gentle breeze kept the red weed that covered every scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying and oh the sweetness of the air chapter six the work of fifteen days for some time i stood tottering on the mound regardless of my safety within that noisome den from which i had emerged i had thought with a narrow intensity only of our immediate security i had not realised what had been happening to the world had not anticipated {

this startling vision of unfamiliar things i had expected to see sheen in ruins i found about me the landscape weird and lurid of another planet for that moment i touched an emotion beyond the common range of men yet one that the poor brutes we dominate know only too well i felt as a rabbit might feel returning to his burrow and suddenly confronted by the work of a dozen busy navvies digging the foundations of a house i felt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew quite clear in my mind that oppressed me for many days a sense of dethronement { 	
dethrone:0 dethroned:-1 dethroner:-1 dethrones:-1 enthroned:-1 }

a persuasion that i was no longer a master but an animal among the animals under the martian heel with us it would be as with them to lurk and watch to run and hide the fear and empire of man had passed away but so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed and my dominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast in the direction away from the pit i saw beyond a red covered wall a patch of garden ground unburied this gave me a hint and i went knee deep and sometimes neck deep in the red weed the density of the weed gave me a reassuring sense of hiding the wall was some six feet high and when i attempted to clamber it i found i could not lift my feet to the crest so i went along by the side of it and came to a corner and a rockwork { 	
rackwork:3 roadwork:-1 ropework:-1 workforce:0 workforces:-1 }

that enabled me to get to the top and tumble into the garden i coveted here i found some young onions a couple of gladiolus bulbs and a quantity of immature carrots all of which i secured and scrambling over a ruined wall went on my way through scarlet and crimson trees towards kew it was like walking through an avenue of gigantic blood drops possessed with two ideas to get more food and to limp as soon and as far as my strength permitted out of this accursed unearthly region of the pit some way farther in a grassy place was a group of mushrooms which also i devoured and then i came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow water where meadows used to be these fragments of nourishment served only to whet my hunger at first i was surprised at this flood in a hot dry summer but afterwards i discovered that it was caused by the tropical exuberance of the red weed directly this extraordinary growth encountered {

fecundity its seeds were simply poured down into the water of the wey and thames and its swiftly growing and titanic water fronds speedily choked both those rivers at putney as i afterwards saw the bridge was almost lost in a tangle of this weed and at richmond too the thames water poured in a broad and shallow stream across the meadows of hampton and twickenham as the water spread the weed followed them until the ruined villas of the thames valley were for a time lost in this red swamp whose margin i explored and much of the desolation the martians had caused was concealed in the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had spread a cankering disease due it is believed to the action of certain bacteria presently seized upon it now by the action of natural selection all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting power against bacterial diseases they never succumb without a severe struggle but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead the fronds became bleached and then shrivelled and brittle they broke off at the least touch and the waters that had stimulated their early growth carried their last vestiges out to sea my first act on coming to this water was of course to slake my thirst i drank a great deal of it and moved by an impulse gnawed some fronds of red weed but they were watery and had a sickly metallic taste i found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to wade securely although the red weed impeded my feet a little but the flood evidently got deeper towards the river and i turned back to mortlake i managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins of its villas and fences and lamps and so presently i got out of this spate and made my way to the hill going up towards roehampton {

spaces houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doors closed as if they had been left for a day by the owners or as if their inhabitants slept within the red weed was less abundant the tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper i hunted for food among the trees finding nothing and i also raided a couple of silent houses but they had already been broken into and ransacked i rested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery being in my enfeebled condition too fatigued to push on all this time i saw no human beings and no signs of the martians i encountered a couple of hungry looking dogs but both hurried circuitously { 	
circuitous:6 circuits:-1 circuity:-1 }

away from the advances i made them near roehampton i had seen two human skeletons not bodies but skeletons picked clean and in the wood by me i found the crushed and scattered bones of several cats and rabbits and the skull of a sheep but though i gnawed parts of these in my mouth there was nothing to be got from them after sunset i struggled on along the road towards putney where i think the heat ray must have been used for some reason and in the garden beyond roehampton i got a quantity of immature potatoes sufficient to stay my hunger from this garden one looked down upon putney and the river the aspect of the place in the dusk was singularly desolate blackened trees blackened desolate ruins and down the hill the sheets of the flooded river red tinged with the weed and over all silence it filled me with indescribable terror to think how swiftly that desolating change had come for a time i believed that mankind had been swept out of existence and that i stood there alone the last man left alive hard by the top of putney hill i came upon another skeleton with the arms dislocated and removed several yards from the rest of the body as i proceeded i became more and more convinced that the extermination of mankind was save for such stragglers as myself already accomplished {

or it might be they had gone northward chapter seven the man on putney hill i spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of putney hill sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to leatherhead i will not tell the needless trouble i had breaking into that house afterwards i found the front door was on the latch nor how i ransacked every room for food until just on the verge of despair in what seemed to me to be a servant s bedroom i found a rat gnawed crust and two tins of pineapple the place had been already searched and emptied in the bar i afterwards found some biscuits and sandwiches that had been overlooked the latter i could not eat they were too rotten but the former not only stayed my hunger but filled my pockets i lit no lamps fearing some martian might come beating that part of london for food in the night before i went to bed i had an interval of restlessness {

of the martians and the possible fate of my wife the former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to recall i saw it simply as a thing done a memory infinitely disagreeable but quite without the quality of remorse i saw myself then as i see myself now driven step by step towards that hasty blow the creature of a sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that i felt no condemnation {

daring of the artilleryman and the tone of assurance and courage he assumed completely dominated my mind i believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny and in the practicability of his astonishing scheme and the reader who thinks me susceptible { 	
susceptive:3 }

and foolish must contrast his position reading steadily with all his thoughts about his subject and mine crouching fearfully in the bushes and listening distracted by apprehension { 	
apprehend:-1 apprehends:1 }

we talked in this manner through the early morning time and later crept out of the bushes and after scanning the sky for martians hurried precipitately to the house on putney hill where he had made his lair it was the coal cellar of the place and when i saw the work he had spent a week upon it was a burrow scarcely ten yards long which he designed to reach to the main drain on putney hill i had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his powers such a hole i could have dug in a day but i believed in him sufficiently to work with him all that morning until past midday at his digging we had a garden barrow and shot the earth we removed against the kitchen range we refreshed ourselves with a tin of mock turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring pantry i found a curious relief from the aching strangeness of the world in this steady labour as we worked i turned his project over in my mind and presently objections and doubts began to arise but i worked there all the morning so glad was i to find myself with a purpose again after working an hour i began to speculate on the distance one had to go before the cloaca was reached the chances we had of missing it altogether my immediate trouble was why we should dig this long tunnel when it was possible to get into the drain at once down one of the manholes and work back to the house it seemed to me too that the house was inconveniently chosen and required a needless length of tunnel and just as i was beginning to face these things the artilleryman stopped digging and looked at me we re working well he said he put down his spade let us knock off a bit he said i think it s time we reconnoitred { 	
recondite:-1 reconsider:-1 }

from the roof of the house i was for going on and after a little hesitation he resumed his spade and then suddenly i was struck by a thought i stopped and so did he at once why were you walking about the common i said instead of being here taking the air he said i was coming back it s safer by night but the work oh one can t always work he said and in a flash i saw the man plain he hesitated holding his spade we ought to reconnoitre { 	
recentring:0 reconnect:0 reconnects:-1 recontinue:0 reconvert:-1 recreation:-1 rencontre:-1 }

now he said because if any come near they may hear the spades and drop upon us unawares i was no longer disposed to object we went together to the roof and stood on a ladder peeping out of the roof door no martians were to be seen and we ventured out on the tiles and slipped down under shelter of the parapet from this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of putney but we could see the river below a bubbly mass of red weed and the low parts of lambeth flooded and red the red creeper swarmed up the trees about the old palace and their branches stretched gaunt and dead and set with shrivelled leaves from amid its clusters it was strange how entirely dependent both these things were upon flowing water for their propagation {

dense smoke was rising and that and a blue haze hid the northward hills the artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people who still remained in london one night last week he said some fools got the electric light in order and there was all regent street and the circus ablaze crowded with painted and ragged drunkards men and women dancing and shouting till dawn a man who was there told me and as the day came they became aware of a fighting machine standing near by the langham {

and looking down at them heaven knows how long he had been there it must have given some of them a nasty turn he came down the road towards them and picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened to run away grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe from that in answer to my questions he came round to his grandiose plans again he grew enthusiastic he talked so eloquently of the possibility of capturing a fighting machine that i more than half believed in him again but now that i was beginning to understand something of his quality i could divine the stress he laid on doing nothing precipitately and i noted that now there was no question that he personally was to capture and fight the great machine after a time we went down to the cellar neither of us seemed disposed to resume digging and when he suggested a meal i was nothing loath he became suddenly very generous and when we had eaten he went away and returned with some excellent cigars we lit these and his optimism glowed he was inclined to regard my coming as a great occasion there s some champagne in the cellar he said we can dig better on this thames side burgundy said i no said he i am host today champagne great god we ve {

with no clear prospect before us but the chance of a horrible death we could sit following the chance of this painted pasteboard and playing the joker with vivid delight afterwards he taught me poker and i beat him at three tough chess games when dark came we decided to take the risk and lit a lamp after an interminable string of games we supped and the artilleryman finished the champagne we went on smoking the cigars he was no longer the energetic regenerator {

of his species i had encountered in the morning he was still optimistic but it was a less kinetic a more thoughtful optimism i remember he wound up with my health proposed in a speech of small variety and considerable intermittence i took a cigar and went upstairs to look at the lights of which he had spoken that blazed so greenly along the highgate hills at first i stared unintelligently across the london valley the northern hills were shrouded in darkness the fires near kensington glowed redly and now and then an orange red tongue of flame flashed up and vanished in the deep blue night all the rest of london was black then nearer i perceived a strange light a pale violet purple fluorescent {

glow quivering under the night breeze for a space i could not understand it and then i knew that it must be the red weed from which this faint irradiation {

proceeded with that realisation my dormant sense of wonder my sense of the proportion of things awoke again i glanced from that to mars red and clear glowing high in the west and then gazed long and earnestly at the darkness of hampstead and highgate i remained a very long time upon the roof wondering at the grotesque changes of the day i recalled my mental states from the midnight prayer to the foolish card playing i had a violent revulsion of feeling i remember i flung away the cigar with a certain wasteful symbolism my folly came to me with glaring exaggeration {

i seemed a traitor to my wife and to my kind i was filled with remorse i resolved to leave this strange undisciplined dreamer of great things to his drink and gluttony and to go on into london there it seemed to me i had the best chance of learning what the martians and my fellowmen {

were doing i was still upon the roof when the late moon rose chapter eight dead london after i had parted from the artilleryman i went down the hill and by the high street across the bridge to fulham the red weed was tumultuous at that time and nearly choked the bridge roadway but its fronds were already whitened in patches by the spreading disease that presently removed it so swiftly at the corner of the lane that runs to putney bridge station i found a man lying he was as black as a sweep with the black dust alive but helplessly and speechlessly { 	
speechless:6 sphereless:-1 }

drunk i could get nothing from him but curses and furious lunges at my head i think i should have stayed by him but for the brutal expression of his face there was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards and it grew thicker in fulham the streets were horribly quiet i got food sour hard and mouldy but quite eatable in a baker s shop here some way towards walham {

the streets were quiet again here i came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon dead bodies i saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the fulham road they had been dead many days so that i hurried quickly past them the black powder covered them over and softened their outlines one or two had been disturbed by dogs where there was no black powder it was curiously like a sunday in the city with the closed shops the houses locked up and the blinds drawn the desertion and the stillness in some places plunderers had been at work but rarely at other than the provision and wine shops a jeweller s window had been broken open in one place but apparently the thief had been disturbed and a number of gold chains and a watch lay scattered on the pavement i did not trouble to touch them farther on was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep the hand that hung over her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown dress and a smashed magnum of champagne formed a pool across the pavement she seemed asleep but she was dead the farther i penetrated into london the profounder grew the stillness but it was not so much the stillness of death it was the stillness of suspense of expectation at any time the destruction that had already singed the northwestern {

borders of the metropolis and had annihilated ealing and kilburn might strike among these houses and leave them smoking ruins it was a city condemned and derelict in south kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black powder it was near south kensington that i first heard the howling it crept almost imperceptibly upon my senses it was a sobbing alternation {

park i had half a mind to break into the natural history museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers in order to see across the park but i decided to keep to the ground where quick hiding was possible and so went on up the exhibition road all the large mansions on each side of the road were empty and still and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses at the top near the park gate i came upon a strange sight a bus overturned and the skeleton of a horse picked clean i puzzled over this for a time and then went on to the bridge over the serpentine the voice grew stronger and stronger though i could see nothing above the housetops on the north side of the park save a haze of smoke to the northwest ulla ulla ulla ulla cried the voice coming as it seemed to me from the district about regent s park the desolating cry worked upon my mind the mood that had sustained me passed the wailing took possession of me i found i was intensely weary footsore and now again hungry and thirsty it was already past noon why was i wandering alone in this city of the dead why was i alone when all london was lying in state and in its black shroud i felt intolerably {

lonely my mind ran on old friends that i had forgotten for years i thought of the poisons in the chemists shops of the liquors the wine merchants stored i recalled the two sodden creatures of despair who so far as i knew shared the city with myself i came into oxford street by the marble arch and here again were black powder and several bodies and an evil ominous smell from the gratings of the cellars of some of the houses i grew very thirsty after the heat of my long walk with infinite trouble i managed to break into a public house and get food and drink i was weary after eating and went into the parlour behind the bar and slept on a black horsehair sofa i found there i awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears ulla ulla ulla ulla it was now dusk and after i had routed out some biscuits and a cheese in the bar there was a meat safe but it contained nothing but maggots i wandered on through the silent residential {

squares to baker street portman square is the only one i can name and so came out at last upon regent s park and as i emerged from the top of baker street i saw far away over the trees in the clearness of the sunset the hood of the martian giant from which this howling proceeded i was not terrified i came upon him as if it were a matter of course i watched him for some time but he did not move he appeared to be standing and yelling for no reason that i could discover i tried to formulate a plan of action that perpetual sound of ulla ulla ulla ulla confused my mind perhaps i was too tired to be very fearful certainly i was more curious to know the reason of this monotonous crying than afraid i turned back away from the park and struck into park road intending to skirt the park went along under the shelter of the terraces and got a view of this stationary howling martian from the direction of st john s wood a couple of hundred yards out of baker street i heard a yelping chorus and saw first a dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws coming headlong towards me and then a pack of starving mongrels in pursuit of him he made a wide curve to avoid me as though he feared i might prove a fresh competitor as the yelping died away down the silent road the wailing sound of ulla ulla ulla ulla reasserted itself i came upon the wrecked handling machine halfway to st john s wood station at first i thought a house had fallen across the road it was only as i clambered among the ruins that i saw with a start this mechanical samson {

lying with its tentacles bent and smashed and twisted among the ruins it had made the forepart was shattered it seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house and had been overwhelmed {

in its overthrow it seemed to me then that this might have happened by a handling machine escaping from the guidance of its martian i could not clamber among the ruins to see it and the twilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seat was smeared and the gnawed gristle of the martian that the dogs had left were invisible to me wondering still more at all that i had seen i pushed on towards primrose hill far away through a gap in the trees i saw a second martian as motionless as the first standing in the park towards the zoological gardens and silent a little beyond the ruins about the smashed handling machine i came upon the red weed again and found the regent s canal a spongy mass of dark red vegetation as i crossed the bridge the sound of ulla ulla ulla ulla ceased it was as it were cut off the silence came like a thunderclap {

the dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim the trees towards the park were growing black all about me the red weed clambered among the ruins writhing to get above me in the dimness night the mother of fear and mystery was coming upon me but while that voice sounded the solitude the desolation had been endurable by virtue of it london had still seemed alive and the sense of life about me had upheld me then suddenly a change the passing of something i knew not what and then a stillness that could be felt nothing but this gaunt quiet london about me gazed at me spectrally the windows in the white houses were like the eye sockets of skulls about me my imagination found a thousand noiseless enemies moving terror seized me a horror of my temerity in front of me the road became pitchy black as though it was tarred and i saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway i could not bring myself to go on i turned down st john s wood road and ran headlong from this unendurable stillness towards kilburn i hid from the night and the silence until long after midnight in a cabmen s shelter in harrow road but before the dawn my courage returned and while the stars were still in the sky i turned once more towards regent s park i missed my way among the streets and presently saw down a long avenue in the half light of the early dawn the curve of primrose hill on the summit towering up to the fading stars was a third martian erect and motionless like the others an insane resolve possessed me i would die and end it and i would save myself even the trouble of killing myself i marched on recklessly towards this titan and then as i drew nearer and the light grew i saw that a multitude of black birds was circling and clustering about the hood at that my heart gave a bound and i began running along the road i hurried through the red weed that choked st edmund {

s terrace i waded breast high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from the waterworks towards the albert road and emerged upon the grass before the rising of the sun great mounds had been heaped about the crest of the hill making a huge redoubt of it it was the final and largest place the martians had made and from behind these heaps there rose a thin smoke against the sky against the sky line an eager dog ran and disappeared the thought that had flashed into my mind grew real grew credible i felt no fear only a wild trembling exultation as i ran up the hill towards the motionless monster out of the hood hung lank shreds of brown at which the hungry birds pecked and tore in another moment i had scrambled up the earthen rampart and stood upon its crest and the interior of the redoubt was below me a mighty space it was with gigantic machines here and there within it huge mounds of material and strange shelter places and scattered about it some in their overturned war machines some in the now rigid handling machines and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a row were the martians dead slain by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems were unprepared slain as the red weed was being slain slain after all man s devices had failed by the humblest things that god in his wisdom has put upon this earth for so it had come about as indeed i and many men might have foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds these germs of disease have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of things taken toll of our prehuman ancestors since life began here but by virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power to no germs do we succumb without a struggle and to many those that cause putrefaction in dead matter for instance our living frames are altogether immune but there are no bacteria in mars and directly these invaders arrived directly they drank and fed our microscopic {

allies began to work their overthrow already when i watched them they were irrevocably doomed dying and rotting even as they went to and fro it was inevitable by the toll of a billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth and it is his against all comers it would still be his were the martians ten times as mighty as they are for neither do men live nor die in vain here and there they were scattered nearly fifty altogether in that great gulf they had made overtaken by a death that must have seemed to them as incomprehensible as any death could be to me also at that time this death was incomprehensible all i knew was that these things that had been alive and so terrible to men were dead for a moment i believed that the destruction of sennacherib { 	
canneries:-1 sennachie:3 sennachies:2 }

had been repeated that god had repented that the angel of death had slain them in the night i stood staring into the pit and my heart lightened gloriously even as the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with his rays the pit was still in darkness the mighty engines so great and wonderful in their power and complexity so unearthly in their tortuous forms rose weird and vague and strange out of the shadows towards the light a multitude of dogs i could hear fought over the bodies that lay darkly in the depth of the pit far below me across the pit on its farther lip flat and vast and strange lay the great flying machine with which they had been experimenting { 	
experiment:4 }

upon our denser atmosphere when decay and death arrested them death had come not a day too soon at the sound of a cawing overhead i looked up at the huge fighting machine that would fight no more for ever at the tattered red shreds of flesh that dripped down upon the overturned seats on the summit of primrose hill i turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where enhaloed now in birds stood those other two martians that i had seen overnight just as death had overtaken them the one had died even as it had been crying to its companions perhaps it was the last to die and its voice had gone on perpetually until the force of its machinery was exhausted they glittered now harmless tripod towers of shining metal in the brightness of the rising sun all about the pit and saved as by a miracle from everlasting {

destruction stretched the great mother of cities those who have only seen london veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine the naked clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses eastward over the blackened ruins of the albert terrace and the splintered spire of the church the sun blazed dazzling in a clear sky and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs caught the light and glared with a white intensity northward were kilburn and hampsted {

blue and crowded with houses westward the great city was dimmed and southward beyond the martians the green waves of regent s park the langham hotel the dome of the albert hall the imperial institute and the giant mansions of the brompton road came out clear and little in the sunrise the jagged ruins of westminster rising hazily beyond far away and blue were the surrey hills and the towers of the crystal palace glittered like two silver rods the dome of st paul s was dark against the sunrise and injured i saw for the first time by a huge gaping cavity on its western side and as i looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories and churches silent and abandoned as i thought of the multitudinous hopes and efforts the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to build this human reef and of the swift and ruthless destruction that had hung over it all when i realised that the shadow had been rolled back and that men might still live in the streets and this dear vast dead city of mine be once more alive and powerful i felt a wave of emotion that was near akin to tears the torment was over even that day the healing would begin the survivors of the people scattered over the country leaderless lawless foodless like sheep without a shepherd the thousands who had fled by sea would begin to return the pulse of life growing stronger and stronger would beat again in the empty streets and pour across the vacant squares whatever destruction was done the hand of the destroyer was stayed all the gaunt wrecks the blackened skeletons of houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of the hill would presently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers and ringing with the tapping of their trowels at the thought i extended my hands towards the sky and began thanking god in a year thought i in a year with overwhelming {

corn bread and meat were tearing to our relief all the shipping in the world seemed going londonward in those days but of all this i have no memory i drifted a demented man i found myself in a house of kindly people who had found me on the third day wandering weeping and raving through the streets of st john s wood they have told me since that i was singing some insane doggerel about the last man left alive hurrah the last man left alive troubled as they were with their own affairs these people whose name much as i would like to express my gratitude to them i may not even give here nevertheless cumbered themselves with me sheltered me and protected me from myself apparently they had learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse very gently when my mind was assured again did they break to me what they had learned of the fate of leatherhead two days after i was imprisoned it had been destroyed with every soul in it by a martian he had swept it out of existence as it seemed without any provocation {

as a boy might crush an ant hill in the mere wantonness of power i was a lonely man and they were very kind to me i was a lonely man and a sad one and they bore with me i remained with them four days after my recovery all that time i felt a vague a growing craving to look once more on whatever remained of the little life that seemed so happy and bright in my past it was a mere hopeless desire to feast upon my misery they dissuaded me they did all they could to divert me from this morbidity but at last i could resist the impulse no longer and promising faithfully to return to them and parting as i will confess from these four day friends with tears i went out again into the streets that had lately been so dark and strange and empty already they were busy with returning people in places even there were shops open and i saw a drinking fountain running water i remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as i went back on my melancholy pilgrimage to the little house at woking how busy the streets and vivid the moving life about me so many people were abroad everywhere busied in a thousand activities that it seemed incredible that any great proportion of the population could have been slain but then i noticed how yellow were the skins of the people i met how shaggy the hair of the men how large and bright their eyes and that every other man still wore his dirty rags their faces seemed all with one of two expressions a leaping exultation and energy or a grim resolution save for the expression of the faces london seemed a city of tramps the vestries were indiscriminately distributing {

to myself and sat with folded arms looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows and just outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary rails and on either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins to clapham junction the face of london was grimy with powder of the black smoke in spite of two days of thunderstorms and rain and at clapham junction the line had been wrecked again there were hundreds of out of work clerks and shopmen working side by side with the customary navvies and we were jolted over a hasty relaying all down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt and unfamiliar wimbledon particularly had suffered walton by virtue of its unburned pine woods seemed the least hurt of any place along the line the wandle the mole every little stream was a heaped mass of red weed in appearance between butcher s meat and pickled cabbage the surrey pine woods were too dry however for the festoons of the red climber beyond wimbledon within sight of the line in certain nursery grounds were the heaped masses of earth about the sixth cylinder a number of people were standing about it and some sappers were busy in the midst of it over it flaunted a union jack flapping cheerfully in the morning breeze the nursery grounds were everywhere crimson with the weed a wide expanse of livid colour cut with purple shadows and very painful to the eye one s gaze went with infinite relief from the scorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground to the blue green softness of the eastward hills the line on the london side of woking station was still undergoing repair so i descended at byfleet station and took the road to maybury past the place where i and the artilleryman had talked to the hussars and on by the spot where the martian had appeared to me in the thunderstorm here moved by curiosity i turned aside to find among a tangle of red fronds the warped and broken dog cart with the whitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed for a time i stood regarding these vestiges then i returned through the pine wood neck high with red weed here and there to find the landlord of the spotted dog had already found burial and so came home past the college arms a man standing at an open cottage door greeted me by name as i passed i looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded immediately the door had been forced it was unfast {

physiology is confined to a book or two but it seems to me that carver s suggestions as to the reason of the rapid death of the martians is so probable as to be regarded almost as a proven conclusion i have assumed that in the body of my narrative at any rate in all the bodies of the martians that were examined after the war no bacteria except those already known as terrestrial species were found that they did not bury any of their dead and the reckless slaughter they perpetrated {

point also to an entire ignorance of the putrefactive process but probable as this seems it is by no means a proven conclusion neither is the composition of the black smoke known which the martians used with such deadly effect and the generator of the heat rays remains a puzzle the terrible disasters at the ealing and south kensington laboratories {

and almost complete specimen in spirits at the natural history museum and the countless drawings that have been made from it and beyond that the interest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific a question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of another attack from the martians i do not think that nearly enough attention is being given to this aspect of the matter at present the planet mars is in conjunction {

but with every return to opposition i for one anticipate a renewal of their adventure in any case we should be prepared it seems to me that it should be possible to define the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged to keep a sustained watch upon this part of the planet and to anticipate the arrival of the next attack in that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or artillery before it was sufficiently cool for the martians to emerge or they might be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw opened it seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the failure of their first surprise possibly they see it in the same light lessing {

has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the martians have actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet venus seven months ago now venus and mars were in alignment with the sun that is to say mars was in opposition from the point of view of an observer on venus subsequently {

a peculiar luminous and sinuous marking appeared on the unillumined { 	
unillumed:3 }

half of the inner planet and almost simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character was detected upon a photograph of the martian disk one needs to see the drawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully their remarkable resemblance in character at any rate whether we expect another invasion or not our views of the human future must be greatly modified by these events we have learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a secure abiding place for man we can never anticipate the unseen good or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space it may be that in the larger design of the universe this invasion from mars is not without its ultimate benefit for men it has robbed us of that serene confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of decadence the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous and it has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of mankind it may be that across the immensity of space the martians have watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson and that on the planet venus they have found a securer settlement be that as it may for many years yet there will certainly be no relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the martian disk and those fiery darts of the sky the shooting stars will bring with them as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men the broadening of men s views that has resulted can scarcely be exaggerated { 	
exaggerate:8 exasperate:0 }

before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty surface of our minute sphere now we see further if the martians can reach venus there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible for men and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth uninhabitable as at last it must do it may be that the thread of life that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planet within its toils dim and wonderful is the vision i have conjured up in my mind of life spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space but that is a remote dream it may be on the other hand that the destruction of the martians is only a reprieve to them and not to us perhaps is the future ordained i must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind i sit in my study writing by lamplight and suddenly i see again the healing valley below set with writhing flames and feel the house behind and about me empty and desolate i go out into the byfleet road and vehicles pass me a butcher boy in a cart a cabful {
