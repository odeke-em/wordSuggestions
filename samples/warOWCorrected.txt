there far  {

at all beyond  {

its earthly  {

level  {

nor  {

was it generally  {

understood  {

that since  {

mars is older than our earth with scarcely a quarter  {
        }
of the superficial  {

area  {

and remoter  {

from the sun it necessarily  {

follows  {

only more  {

its end the secular  {

cooling that must someday  {

our planet has already  {

gone  {

far indeed with our neighbour  {

its physical  {

condition  {

is still  {

largely  {

a mystery  {

but we know  {
 }
now  {
 }
that even  {
 }
in its equatorial  {

region  {
 }
the midday  {
 }
temperature barely approaches  {
 }
that of our coldest  {
  }
winter  {
 }
its air is much  {
  }
more attenuated  {

than ours its oceans  {
  }
have shrunk  {

until  {
 }
they cover  {

but a third  {

change  {

huge  {

snowcaps  {

gather  {

of mars the immediate  {

pressure  {

of necessity  {

has brightened  {

their intellects enlarged  {
 }
their powers  {

and hardened  {
 }
their hearts  {
 }
and looking  {
 }
across space with instruments  {
  }
and intelligences such  {
 }
as we have scarcely dreamed  {
   }
of they see  {

at its nearest  {

distance only of miles sunward  {
   }
of them a morning  {

star of hope  {

our own warmer  {

planet green  {

with vegetation  {

and grey  {

with water with a cloudy  {

atmosphere  {

eloquent  {

of fertility  {

with glimpses  {

through  {

its drifting  {

cloud wisps  {
 }
of broad  {
 }
stretches  {
 }
of populous  {
 }
country  {
 }
and narrow navy  {
 }
crowded  {
 }
seas and we men the creatures who inhabit this earth must be to them at least  {
              }
as alien  {
 }
and lowly  {
 }
as are the monkeys  {
  }
and lemurs  {
 }
to us the intellectual  {
  }
side  {
 }
of man already admits  {
  }
that life is an incessant  {
   }
struggle  {
 }
for existence and it would seem  {
    }
that this too  {
 }
is the belief  {
 }
of the minds upon mars their world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals  {
                             }
to carry  {
 }
warfare  {
 }
sunward is indeed their only escape  {
    }
from the destruction  {
 }
that generation  {
 }
after  {
 }
generation creeps  {
 }
upon them and before we judge  {
    }
of them too harshly  {
  }
we must remember  {
 }
what ruthless  {
 }
and utter  {
 }
destruction our own species  {
  }
has wrought  {
 }
not only upon animals such as the vanished  {
      }
bison  {
 }
and the dodo  {
 }
but upon its inferior races  {

years are we such apostles  {

as to complain  {

if the martians warred  {

in the same spirit  {

the martians seem to have calculated  {
    }
their descent  {
 }
with amazing  {
 }
subtlety  {
 }
their mathematical  {

 }
learning  {

is evidently  {

far in excess  {

of ours and to have carried  {

out their preparations  {

with a well nigh  {

perfect  {

unanimity  {

had  {

our instruments permitted  {

it we might have seen  {

the gathering  {

trouble  {

in the nineteenth century men like schiaparelli  {

watched the red  {

by the bye  {

that for countless  {

centuries  {

mars has been  {

the star of war but failed  {

to interpret  {

the fluctuating  {

appearances  {

of the markings  {

they mapped  {

so well all that time the martians must have been getting  {

 }
to which he had at once  {
    }
resorted  {
 }
indicated  {
 }
a mass  {
 }
of flaming  {
 }
gas chiefly  {
 }
hydrogen  {
 }
moving  {
 }
with an enormous  {
 }
velocity  {
 }
towards this earth this jet  {
   }
of fire had become invisible  {
   }
about a quarter past  {
  }
twelve  {
 }
he compared  {
 }
it to a colossal  {
  }
puff  {
 }
of flame  {
 }
suddenly  {
 }
and violently  {
 }
squirted  {
 }
out of the planet as flaming gases  {
     }
rushed  {
 }
out of a gun a singularly  {
    }
appropriate  {
 }
phrase  {
 }
it proved  {
 }
yet the next day there was nothing  {
     }
of this in the papers  {
   }
except  {
 }
a little note  {
 }
in the daily  {
 }
telegraph  {
 }
and the world went in ignorance  {
    }
of one of the gravest  {
   }
dangers  {
 }
that ever  {
 }
threatened  {
 }
the human race i might not have heard of the eruption  {
         }
at all had i not met  {
    }
ogilvy  {
 }
the well known  {
 }
astronomer  {
 }
at ottershaw  {
 }
he was immensely  {
 }
excited  {
 }
at the news  {
 }
and in the excess of his feelings  {
     }
invited  {
 }
me up to take  {
  }
a turn  {
 }
with him  {
 }
that night  {
 }
in a scrutiny  {
 }
of the red planet in spite of all that has happened  {
         }
since i still remember that vigil  {
    }
very distinctly  {
 }
the black  {
 }
and silent  {
 }
observatory the shadowed  {
 }
lantern  {
 }
throwing  {
 }
a feeble  {
 }
glow  {
 }
upon the floor  {
 }
in the corner  {
 }
the steady  {
 }
ticking  {
 }
of the clockwork  {
 }
of the telescope  {
 }
the little slit  {
 }
in the roof  {
 }
an oblong  {
 }
profundity  {
 }
with the stardust  {
	strndupa :: 8
	strad :: 8
	sturdy :: 8
	startup :: 8
	stardom :: 8
	stared :: 8
	star :: 8
 }
streaked  {
 }
across it ogilvy moved  {
  }
about invisible but audible  {
  }
looking through the telescope one saw  {
    }
a circle  {
 }
of deep  {
 }
blue  {
 }
and the little round  {
  }
planet swimming  {
 }
in the field  {
 }
it seemed  {
 }
such a little thing so bright and small  {
      }
and still faintly  {
 }
marked  {
 }
with transverse  {
 }
stripes  {
 }
and slightly  {
 }
flattened  {
 }
from the perfect round but so little it was so silvery  {
         }
warm a pin  {
 }
s head  {
 }
of light it was as if it quivered  {
      }
but really  {
 }
this was the telescope vibrating  {
   }
with the activity  {
 }
of the clockwork that kept  {
   }
the planet in view  {
  }
as i watched the planet seemed to grow  {
      }
larger  {
 }
and smaller  {
 }
and to advance  {
 }
and recede  {
 }
but that was simply  {
  }
that my eye was tired  {
   }
forty  {
 }
millions  {
 }
of miles it was from us more than forty millions of miles of void  {
            }
few  {
 }
people  {
 }
realise  {
 }
the immensity  {
 }
of vacancy  {
 }
in which the dust  {
  }
of the material  {
 }
universe  {
 }
swims  {
 }
near it in the field i remember were three  {
       }
faint points  {
 }
of light three telescopic  {
  }
stars  {
 }
infinitely  {
 }
remote and all around  {
  }
it was the unfathomable  {
  }
darkness  {
 }
of empty  {
 }
space you know how that blackness  {
    }
looks  {
 }
on a frosty  {
 }
starlight  {
 }
night in a telescope it seems  {
    }
far profounder  {
 }
and invisible to me because  {
   }
it was so remote and small flying  {
     }
swiftly  {
 }
and steadily  {
 }
towards me across that incredible  {
   }
distance drawing  {
 }
nearer every  {
 }
minute  {
 }
by so many  {
 }
thousands  {
 }
of miles came the thing they were sending  {
      }
us the thing that was to bring  {
     }
so much struggle and calamity  {
   }
and death  {
 }
to the earth i never  {
   }
dreamed of it then as i watched no one on earth dreamed of that unerring  {
             }
missile  {
 }
that night too there was another  {
    }
jetting  {
 }
out of gas from the distant planet i saw it a reddish  {
          }
flash  {
 }
at the edge  {
 }
the slightest  {
 }
projection  {
 }
of the outline  {
 }
just  {
 }
as the chronometer  {
	chromene :: 12
	chromate :: 11
 }
struck  {
 }
midnight and at that i told  {
    }
ogilvy and he took  {
  }
my place  {
 }
the night was warm and i was thirsty  {
      }
and i went stretching  {
  }
my legs  {
 }
clumsily  {
 }
and feeling my way  {
  }
in the darkness to the little table  {
     }
where  {
 }
the siphon  {
 }
stood  {
 }
while  {
 }
ogilvy exclaimed  {
 }
at the streamer  {
 }
of gas that came out towards us that night another invisible missile started  {
           }
on its way to the earth from mars just a second  {
         }
or so under twenty  {
  }
four  {
 }
hours  {
 }
after the first one i remember how i sat  {
       }
on the table there in the blackness with patches  {
       }
of green and crimson  {
  }
swimming before my eyes i wished  {
    }
i had a light to smoke  {
    }
by little suspecting  {
 }
the meaning  {
 }
of the minute gleam  {
  }
i had seen and all that it would presently  {
       }
bring me ogilvy watched till  {
   }
one and then gave it up and we lit the lantern and walked  {
           }
over to his house  {
  }
down  {
 }
below  {
 }
in the darkness were ottershaw and chertsey  {
	cherty :: 11
     }
and all their hundreds  {
  }
of people sleeping  {
 }
in peace  {
 }
he was full  {
 }
of speculation  {
 }
that night about the condition of mars and scoffed  {
       }
at the vulgar  {
 }
idea of its having  {
  }
inhabitants who were signalling  {
  }
us his idea was that meteorites  {
    }
might be falling  {
 }
in a heavy  {
 }
shower  {
 }
upon the planet or that a huge volcanic  {
      }
explosion  {
 }
was in progress  {
 }
he pointed  {
 }
out to me how unlikely  {
   }
it was that organic  {
  }
evolution  {
 }
had taken  {
 }
the same direction  {
 }
in the two adjacent  {
  }
planets  {
 }
the chances  {
 }
against anything  {
 }
manlike  {
 }
on mars are a million to one he said  {
       }
hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after about midnight and again the night after and so for ten  {
                     }
nights  {
 }
a flame each  {
 }
night why  {
 }
the shots ceased after the tenth  {
    }
no one on earth has attempted  {
    }
to explain  {
 }
it may be the gases of the firing  {
      }
caused  {
 }
the martians inconvenience  {

dense  {

of smoke or dust visible  {

through a powerful  {

       }
through the clearness  {

of the planet s atmosphere and obscured  {
     }
its more familiar  {

even the daily papers woke  {

up to the disturbances  {

at last and popular  {

appeared  {

here  {

concerning  {

those missiles  {

the martians had fired at us drew earthward  {
      }
rushing  {
 }
now at a pace  {
  }
of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space hour by hour and day by day nearer and nearer it seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful  {
                           }
that with that swift fate  {
   }
hanging  {
 }
over us men could go about their petty  {
      }
concerns as they did  {
  }
i remember how jubilant  {
  }
markham  {
 }
was at securing  {
 }
a new photograph  {
 }
of the planet for the illustrated  {
	illustrate :: 14
    }
paper he edited  {
 }
in those days people in these latter  {
     }
times  {
 }
scarcely realise the abundance  {
  }
and enterprise of our nineteenth century papers for my own part i was much occupied  {
             }
in learning to ride  {
  }
the bicycle  {
 }
and busy  {
 }
upon a series  {
 }
of papers discussing  {
 }
the probable  {
 }
developments  {
	development :: 17
 }
of moral  {
 }
ideas  {
 }
as civilisation  {
 }
progressed  {
 }
one night the first missile then could scarcely have been miles away i went for a walk with my wife  {
                  }
it was starlight and i explained  {
    }
the signs  {
 }
of the zodiac  {
 }
to her and pointed out mars a bright dot  {
       }
of light creeping  {
 }
zenithward  {
 }
towards which so many telescopes  {
   }
were pointed it was a warm night coming home  {
       }
a party  {
 }
of excursionists  {
 }
from chertsey or isleworth  {
  }
passed  {
 }
us singing  {
 }
and playing  {
 }
music  {
 }
there were lights  {
 }
in the upper  {
 }
windows  {
 }
of the houses  {
 }
as the people went to bed  {
    }
from the railway  {
 }
station  {
 }
in the distance came the sound  {
    }
of shunting  {
 }
trains  {
 }
ringing  {
 }
and rumbling  {
 }
softened  {
 }
almost into melody  {
 }
by the distance my wife pointed out to me the brightness  {
         }
of the red green and yellow  {
    }
signal lights hanging in a framework  {
    }
against the sky  {
 }
it seemed so safe  {
  }
and tranquil  {
 }
chapter two the falling star then came the night of the first falling star it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester  {
                      }
eastward  {
 }
a line  {
 }
of flame high  {
 }
in the atmosphere hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary  {
            }
falling star albin  {
	albiness :: 8
	albinos :: 8
	albinic :: 8
	blain :: 8
	albino :: 9
 }
described  {
 }
it as leaving  {
 }
a greenish  {
 }
streak behind  {
 }
it that glowed  {
 }
for some seconds  {
 }
denning  {
 }
our greatest  {
 }
authority  {
 }
on meteorites stated  {
 }
that the height  {
 }
of its first appearance was about ninety  {
     }
or one hundred miles it seemed to him that it fell  {
         }
to earth about one hundred miles east of him i was at home at that hour and writing  {
                }
in my study  {
 }
and although  {
 }
my french  {
 }
windows face  {
 }
towards ottershaw and the blind was up for i loved  {
        }
in those days to look up at the night sky i saw nothing of it yet this strangest  {
                }
of all things that ever came to earth from outer  {
        }
space must have fallen  {
  }
while i was sitting  {
  }
there visible to me had i only looked  {
      }
up as it passed some of those who saw its flight  {
         }
say  {
 }
it travelled  {
 }
with a hissing  {
 }
sound i myself  {
 }
heard nothing of that many people in berkshire  {
	  berks :: 10
      }
surrey  {
 }
and middlesex  {
	middles :: 11
 }
must have seen the fall of it and at most have thought that another meteorite had descended  {
               }
no one seems to have troubled  {
    }
to look for the fallen mass that night but very early in the morning poor  {
             }
ogilvy who had seen the shooting  {
    }
star and who was persuaded  {
   }
that a meteorite lay  {

somewhere  {

on the common  {

 }
rose  {
 }
early with the idea of finding  {
    }
it find it he did soon  {
    }
after dawn  {
 }
and not far from the sand  {
    }
pits  {
 }
an enormous hole  {
 }
had been made by the impact  {
    }
of the projectile  {
 }
and the sand and gravel  {
   }
had been flung  {
 }
violently in every direction over the heath  {
     }
forming  {
 }
heaps  {
 }
visible a mile and a half away the heather  {
       }
was on fire eastward and a thin blue smoke rose against the dawn the thing itself  {
              }
lay almost entirely buried  {
  }
in sand amidst  {
 }
the scattered  {
 }
splinters  {
 }
of a fir tree  {
  }
it had shivered  {
 }
to fragments  {
 }
in its descent the uncovered  {
   }
part had the appearance of a huge cylinder  {
      }
caked  {
 }
over and its outline softened by a thick  {
      }
scaly  {
 }
dun  {
 }
coloured  {
 }
incrustation  {
	incrust :: 14
	incrusts :: 13
 }
it had a diameter  {
  }
of about thirty  {
 }
yards  {
 }
he approached the mass surprised  {
   }
at the size  {
 }
and more so at the shape  {
    }
since most meteorites are rounded  {
   }
more or less  {
 }
completely  {
 }
it was however  {
 }
still so hot  {
 }
from its flight through the air as to forbid  {
       }
his near approach a stirring  {
   }
noise  {
 }
within  {
 }
its cylinder he ascribed  {
  }
to the unequal  {
 }
cooling of its surface for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow  {
                 }
he remained  {
 }
standing  {
 }
at the edge of the pit that the thing had made for itself staring  {
            }
at its strange appearance astonished  {
   }
chiefly at its unusual  {
  }
shape and colour and dimly  {
   }
perceiving  {
 }
even then some evidence  {
  }
of design  {
 }
in its arrival  {
 }
the early morning was wonderfully  {
	wonderful :: 18
   }
still and the sun just clearing  {
    }
the pine  {
 }
trees  {
 }
towards weybridge  {
 }
was already warm he did not remember hearing  {
      }
any birds  {
 }
that morning there was certainly  {
   }
no breeze  {
 }
stirring and the only sounds  {
   }
were the faint movements  {
  }
from within the cindery  {
  }
cylinder he was all alone  {
   }
on the common then suddenly he noticed  {
     }
with a start that some of the grey clinker  {
       }
the ashy  {
 }
incrustation that covered  {
 }
the meteorite was falling off  {
   }
the circular  {
 }
edge of the end it was dropping  {
     }
off in flakes  {
 }
and raining  {
 }
down upon the sand a large piece  {
     }
suddenly came off and fell with a sharp  {
      }
noise that brought  {
 }
his heart into his mouth  {
   }
for a minute he scarcely realised  {
    }
what this meant  {
 }
and although the heat was excessive  {
    }
he clambered  {
 }
down into the pit close to the bulk  {
      }
to see the thing more clearly  {
    }
he fancied even then that the cooling of the body  {
        }
might account  {
 }
for this but what disturbed  {
   }
that idea was the fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder and then he perceived  {
                   }
that very slowly the circular top  {
    }
of the cylinder was rotating  {
   }
on its body it was such a gradual  {
      }
movement that he discovered  {
  }
it only through noticing  {
  }
that a black mark that had been near him five  {
        }
minutes  {
 }
ago was now at the other side of the circumference  {
        }
even then he scarcely understood what this indicated until he heard a muffled  {
           }
grating  {
 }
sound and saw the black mark jerk  {
     }
forward  {
 }
an inch  {
 }
or so then the thing came upon him in a flash the cylinder was artificial  {
             }
hollow with an end that screwed  {
    }
out something  {
 }
within the cylinder was unscrewing  {
   }
the top good  {
 }
heavens  {
 }
said ogilvy there s a man in it men in it half roasted  {
           }
to death trying  {
 }
to escape at once with a quick  {
     }
mental leap  {
 }
he linked  {
 }
the thing with the flash upon mars the thought of the confined  {
          }
creature was so dreadful  {
  }
to him that he forgot  {
   }
the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help  {
        }
turn but luckily  {
 }
the dull  {
 }
radiation  {
 }
arrested  {
 }
him before he could burn  {
   }
his hands  {
 }
on the still glowing  {
  }
metal  {
 }
at that he stood irresolute  {
   }
for a moment  {
 }
then turned  {
 }
scrambled  {
 }
out of the pit and set off running  {
      }
wildly  {
 }
into woking the time then must have been somewhere about six o clock he met a waggoner  {
               }
and tried  {
 }
to make  {
 }
him understand  {
 }
but the tale  {
 }
he told and his appearance were so wild his hat  {
        }
had fallen off in the pit that the man simply drove  {
         }
on he was equally  {
  }
unsuccessful  {
 }
with the potman  {
 }
who was just unlocking  {
  }
the doors  {
 }
of the public  {
 }
house by horsell bridge  {
  }
the fellow  {
 }
thought he was a lunatic  {
   }
at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to shut  {
       }
him into the taproom  {
  }
that sobered  {
 }
him a little and when  {
   }
he saw henderson  {
	donders :: 10
	vendors :: 10
	handers :: 10
	hinders :: 10
 }
the london  {
 }
journalist  {
 }
in his garden  {
 }
he called  {
 }
over the palings  {
 }
and made himself  {
 }
understood henderson he called you saw that shooting star last night well said henderson it s out on horsell common now good lord said henderson fallen meteorite that s good but it s something more than a meteorite it s a cylinder an artificial cylinder man and there s something inside  {
                                                 }
henderson stood up with his spade  {
    }
in his hand what s that he said he was deaf  {
         }
in one ear ogilvy told him all that he had seen henderson was a minute or so taking  {
                }
it in then he dropped  {
   }
his spade snatched  {
 }
up his jacket  {
 }
and came out into the road  {
    }
the two men hurried  {
  }
back at once to the common and found  {
      }
the cylinder still lying  {
  }
in the same position  {
  }
but now the sounds inside had ceased and a thin circle of bright metal showed  {
             }
between the top and the body of the cylinder air was either entering  {
           }
or escaping  {
 }
at the rim  {
 }
with a thin sizzling  {
  }
sound they listened  {
 }
rapped  {
 }
on the scaly burnt  {
  }
metal with a stick  {
  }
and meeting  {
 }
with no response  {
 }
they both  {
 }
concluded  {
 }
the man or men inside must be insensible  {
      }
or dead  {
 }
of course the two were quite  {
    }
unable  {
 }
to do anything they shouted  {
   }
consolation  {
 }
and promises  {
 }
and went off back to the town  {
     }
again to get help one can  {
    }
imagine  {
 }
them covered with sand excited and disordered  {
     }
running up the little street  {
   }
in the bright sunlight  {
  }
just as the shop  {
  }
folks  {
 }
were taking down their shutters  {
   }
and people were opening  {
  }
their bedroom  {
 }
windows henderson went into the railway station at once in order  {
         }
to telegraph the news to london the newspaper  {
      }
articles  {
 }
had prepared  {
 }
men s minds for the reception  {
    }
of the idea by eight  {
   }
o clock a number  {
  }
of boys  {
 }
and unemployed  {
 }
men had already started for the common to see the dead men from mars that was the form the story  {
                  }
took i heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a quarter to nine when i went out to get my daily chronicle  {
                      }
i was naturally  {
 }
startled  {
 }
and lost  {
 }
no time in going  {
  }
out and across the ottershaw bridge to the sand pits chapter three on horsell common i found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding  {
                       }
the huge hole in which the cylinder lay i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk embedded  {
                 }
in the ground  {
 }
the turf  {
 }
and gravel about it seemed charred  {
    }
as if by a sudden explosion no doubt  {
      }
its impact had caused a flash of fire henderson and ogilvy were not there i think they perceived that nothing was to be done  {
                      }
for the present and had gone away to breakfast  {
       }
at henderson s house there were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the pit with their feet  {
                  }
dangling  {
 }
and amusing  {
 }
themselves until i stopped  {
  }
them by throwing stones  {
  }
at the giant  {
 }
mass after i had spoken  {
   }
to them about it they began  {
    }
playing at touch  {
 }
in and out of the group  {
    }
of bystanders  {
 }
among  {
 }
these were a couple  {
  }
of cyclists  {
 }
a jobbing  {
 }
gardener  {
 }
i employed  {
 }
sometimes  {
 }
a girl  {
 }
carrying  {

a baby  {

    }
of this object  {
 }
was at all evident to me at the first glance  {
        }
it was really no more exciting  {
    }
than an overturned  {
 }
carriage  {
 }
or a tree blown  {
  }
across the road not so much so indeed it looked like a rusty  {
           }
gas float  {
 }
it required  {
 }
a certain amount  {
 }
of scientific  {
 }
education  {
 }
to perceive that the grey scale  {
    }
of the thing was no common oxide  {
     }
that the yellowish  {
 }
white  {
 }
metal that gleamed  {
 }
in the crack  {
 }
between the lid  {
 }
and the cylinder had an unfamiliar  {
    }
hue  {
 }
extra  {
 }
terrestrial had no meaning for most of the onlookers  {
       }
at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come  {
              }
from the planet mars but i judged  {
     }
it improbable that it contained  {
   }
any living  {
 }
creature i thought the unscrewing might be automatic  {
      }
in spite of ogilvy i still believed that there were men in mars my mind ran  {
              }
fancifully  {
 }
on the possibilities  {
 }
of its containing  {
 }
manuscript  {
 }
on the difficulties  {
 }
in translation  {
 }
that might arise  {
 }
whether  {
 }
we should  {
 }
find coins  {
 }
and models  {
 }
in it and so forth  {
   }
yet it was a little too large for assurance on this idea i felt  {
            }
an impatience  {
 }
to see it opened  {
  }
about eleven  {
 }
as nothing seemed happening  {
  }
i walked back full of such thought to my home in maybury  {
          }
but i found it difficult to get to work  {
       }
upon my abstract  {
 }
investigations  {
 }
in the afternoon  {
 }
the appearance of the common had altered  {
     }
very much the early editions  {
   }
of the evening  {
 }
papers had startled london with enormous headlines  {
     }
a message  {
 }
received from mars remarkable  {
  }
story from woking and so forth in addition  {
      }
ogilvy s wire to the astronomical exchange had roused  {
       }
every observatory in the three kingdoms  {
    }
there were half a dozen  {
   }
flies  {
 }
or more from the woking station standing in the road by the sand pits a basket  {
              }
chaise  {
 }
from chobham  {
	choriamb :: 9
 }
and a rather  {
 }
lordly  {
 }
carriage besides  {
 }
that there was quite a heap of bicycles  {
      }
in addition a large number of people must have walked in spite of the heat of the day from woking and chertsey so that there was altogether  {
                         }
quite a considerable  {
	considerably :: 21
 }
crowd one or two gaily  {
   }
dressed  {
 }
ladies  {
 }
among the others  {
 }
it was glaringly  {
 }
hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath  {
        }
of wind and the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees the burning  {
              }
heather had been extinguished  {
	extinguish :: 17
  }
but the level ground towards ottershaw was blackened  {
      }
as far as one could see and still giving  {
       }

dealer  {
 }
in the chobham road had sent  {
    }
up his son  {
 }
with a barrow  {
 }
load  {
 }
of green apples  {
 }
and ginger  {
 }
beer  {
 }
going to the edge of the pit i found it occupied by a group of about half a dozen  {
                 }
men henderson ogilvy and a tall  {
    }
fair  {
 }
haired  {
 }
man that i afterwards  {
  }
learned  {
 }
was stent  {
 }
the astronomer royal  {
 }
with several  {
 }
workmen  {
 }
wielding  {
 }
spades  {
 }
and pickaxes  {
 }
stent was giving directions  {
  }
in a clear high pitched  {
   }
voice  {
 }
he was standing on the cylinder which was now evidently much cooler  {
          }
his face was crimson and streaming  {
    }
with perspiration  {
	preservation :: 14
 }
and something seemed to have irritated  {
    }
him a large portion  {
  }
of the cylinder had been uncovered though its lower  {
       }
end was still embedded as soon as ogilvy saw me among the staring crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down and asked  {
                           }
me if i would mind going over to see lord hilton  {
         }
the lord of the manor  {
   }
the growing  {
 }
crowd he said was becoming  {
   }
a serious  {
 }
impediment  {
 }
to their excavations  {
	excavation :: 17
 }
especially  {
 }
the boys they wanted  {
  }
a light railing  {
 }
put  {
 }
up and help to keep  {
   }
the people back he told me that a faint stirring was occasionally  {
	 occasional :: 11
	 salicional :: 10
	  scallions :: 10
	   occasion :: 10
	   scansion :: 10
	   scallion :: 10
          }
still audible within the case  {
   }
but that the workmen had failed to unscrew the top as it afforded  {
           }
no grip  {
 }
to them the case appeared to be enormously  {
      }
thick and it was possible that the faint sounds we heard represented  {
          }
a noisy  {
 }
tumult  {
 }
in the interior  {
 }
i was very glad  {
  }
to do as he asked and so become one of the privileged  {
          }
spectators  {
 }
within the contemplated  {
 }
enclosure  {
 }
i failed to find lord hilton at his house but i was told he was expected  {
              }
from london by the six o clock train from waterloo  {
	waterlogs :: 12
	 waterlog :: 13
        }
and as it was then about a quarter past five i went home had some tea  {
              }
and walked up to the station to waylay  {
      }
him chapter four the cylinder opens  {
    }
when i returned  {
 }
to the common the sun was setting  {
     }
scattered groups  {
 }
were hurrying  {
 }
from the direction of woking and one or two persons  {
        }
were returning  {
 }
the crowd about the pit had increased  {
     }
and stood out black against the lemon  {
     }
yellow of the sky a couple of hundred people perhaps there were raised  {
           }
voices  {
 }
and some sort  {
 }
of struggle appeared to be going on about the pit strange imaginings  {
          }
passed through my mind as i drew nearer i heard stent s voice keep back keep back a boy came running towards me it s a movin he said to me as he passed a screwin  {
	                           screwing :: 13
	                          screwings :: 12
                                  }
and a screwin out i don t like it i m a goin ome  {
            }
i am i went on to the crowd there were really i should think two or three hundred people elbowing  {
                  }
and jostling  {
 }
one another the one or two ladies there being by no means  {
          }
the least active  {
 }
he s fallen in the pit cried  {
     }
some one keep back said several the crowd swayed  {
       }
a little and i elbowed  {
   }
my way through every one seemed greatly  {
     }
excited i heard a peculiar humming  {
    }
sound from the pit i say said ogilvy help keep these idiots  {
          }
back we don t know what s in the confounded  {
        }
thing you know i saw a young  {
     }
man a shop assistant  {
  }
in woking i believe he was standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again the crowd had pushed  {
                     }
him in the end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within nearly  {
            }
two feet of shining  {
  }
screw projected  {
 }
somebody  {
 }
blundered  {
 }
against me and i narrowly missed  {
    }
being pitched onto  {
 }
the top of the screw i turned and as i did so the screw must have come out for the lid of the cylinder fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion  {
                              }
i stuck  {
 }
my elbow into the person behind me and turned my head towards the thing again for a moment that circular cavity  {
                   }
seemed perfectly  {
 }
black i had the sunset  {
   }
in my eyes i think everyone  {
    }
expected to see a man emerge  {
    }
possibly  {
 }
something a little unlike us terrestrial men but in all essentials  {
         }
a man i know i did but looking i presently saw something stirring within the shadow greyish  {
               }
billowy  {
 }
movements one above  {
 }
another and then two luminous  {
   }
disks  {
 }
like eyes then something resembling  {
   }
a little grey snake  {
  }
about the thickness  {
 }
of a walking  {
 }
stick coiled  {
 }
up out of the writhing  {
   }
middle and wriggled  {
 }
in the air towards me and then another a sudden chill  {
         }
came over me there was a loud  {
     }
shriek  {
 }
from a woman  {
 }
behind i half turned keeping  {
   }
my eyes fixed  {
 }
upon the cylinder still from which other tentacles  {
      }
were now projecting  {
 }
and began pushing  {
 }
my way back from the edge of the pit i saw astonishment  {
          }
giving place to horror  {
  }
on the faces  {
 }
of the people about me i heard inarticulate  {
      }
exclamations  {
 }
on all sides  {
 }
there was a general movement backwards  {
    }
i saw the shopman  {
  }
struggling  {
 }
still on the edge of the pit i found myself alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off stent among them i looked again at the cylinder and ungovernable  {
                                 }
terror  {
 }
gripped  {
 }
me i stood petrified  {
  }
and staring a big greyish rounded bulk the size  {
       }
perhaps of a bear  {
  }
was rising  {
 }
slowly and painfully  {
 }
out of the cylinder as it bulged  {
     }
up and caught  {
 }
the light it glistened  {
  }
like wet  {
 }
leather  {
 }
two large dark coloured eyes were regarding  {
     }
me steadfastly  {
	steadily :: 11
	steady :: 11
 }
the mass that framed  {
  }
them the head of the thing was rounded and had one might say a face there was a mouth under the eyes the lipless  {
                      }
brim  {
 }
of which quivered and panted  {
   }
and dropped saliva  {
 }
the whole  {
 }
creature heaved  {
 }
and pulsated  {
 }
convulsively  {
	convulsive :: 17
 }
a lank  {
 }
tentacular  {
 }
appendage  {
 }
gripped the edge of the cylinder another swayed in the air those who have never seen a living martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of its appearance the peculiar v shaped  {
                              }
mouth with its pointed upper lip the absence  {
      }
of brow  {
 }
ridges  {
 }
the absence of a chin  {
   }
beneath  {
 }
the wedgelike  {
 }
lower lip the incessant quivering  {
   }
of this mouth the gorgon  {
   }
groups of tentacles the tumultuous  {
   }
breathing  {
 }
of the lungs  {
 }
in a strange atmosphere the evident heaviness  {
     }
and painfulness  {
	painful :: 14
	painfuller :: 14
 }
of movement due  {
 }
to the greater gravitational  {
	graviton :: 14
	gravitons :: 13
  }
energy  {
 }
of the earth above all the extraordinary  {
     }
intensity  {
 }
of the immense eyes were at once vital  {
      }
intense  {
 }
inhuman  {
 }
crippled  {
 }
and monstrous  {
 }
there was something fungoid  {
  }
in the oily  {
 }
brown  {
 }
skin  {
 }
something in the clumsy  {
  }
deliberation  {
 }
of the tedious  {
 }
movements unspeakably  {
 }
nasty  {
 }
even at this first encounter  {
   }
this first glimpse i was overcome  {
    }
with disgust  {
 }
and dread suddenly the monster  {
   }
vanished it had toppled  {
  }
over the brim of the cylinder and fallen into the pit with a thud  {
            }
like the fall of a great mass of leather i heard it give a peculiar thick cry  {
               }
and forthwith  {
 }
another of these creatures appeared darkly  {
    }
in the deep shadow of the aperture  {
     }
i turned and running madly  {
   }
made for the first group of trees perhaps a hundred yards away but i ran slantingly  {
              }
and stumbling  {
 }
for i could not avert  {
   }
my face from these things there among some young pine trees and furze  {
           }
bushes  {
 }
i stopped panting  {
 }
and waited  {
 }
further  {
 }
developments the common round the sand pits was dotted  {
       }
with people standing like myself in a half fascinated  {
       }
terror staring at these creatures or rather at the heaped  {
        }
gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay and then with a renewed  {
              }
horror i saw a round black object bobbing  {
      }
up and down on the edge of the pit it was the head of the shopman who had fallen in but showing  {
                    }
as a little black object against the hot western  {
       }
sun now he got his shoulder  {
    }
and knee  {
 }
up and again he seemed to slip  {
     }
back until only his head was visible suddenly he vanished and i could have fancied a faint shriek had reached  {
                  }
me i had a momentary  {
   }
impulse  {
 }
to go back and help him that my fears  {
       }
overruled  {
 }
everything  {
 }
was then quite invisible hidden  {
   }
by the deep pit and the heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made anyone coming along  {
                  }
the road from chobham or woking would have been amazed  {
        }
at the sight  {
 }
a dwindling  {
 }
multitude  {
 }
of perhaps a hundred people or more standing in a great irregular  {
          }
circle in ditches  {
 }
behind bushes behind gates  {
  }
and hedges  {
 }
saying  {
 }
little to one another and that in short  {
      }
excited shouts  {
 }
and staring staring hard at a few heaps of sand the barrow of ginger beer stood a queer  {
                }
derelict  {
 }
black against the burning sky and in the sand pits was a row  {
           }
of deserted  {
 }
vehicles  {
 }
with their horses  {
 }
feeding  {
 }
out of nosebags  {
 }
or pawing  {

the ground chapter five the heat ray  {
     }
after the glimpse i had had of the martians emerging  {
        }
from the cylinder in which they had come to the earth from their planet a kind  {
              }
of fascination  {

 }
paralysed  {
 }
my actions  {
 }
i remained standing knee deep in the heather staring at the mound  {
          }
that hid them i was a battleground  {
     }
of fear and curiosity  {
  }
i did not dare  {
  }
to go back towards the pit but i felt a passionate  {
         }
longing  {
 }
to peer  {
 }
into it i began walking therefore  {
    }
in a big curve  {
  }
seeking  {
 }
some point of vantage  {
  }
and continually  {
	continual :: 15
 }
looking at the sand heaps that hid these new comers  {
        }
to our earth once a leash  {
    }
of thin black whips  {
  }
like the arms  {
 }
of an octopus  {
 }
flashed  {
 }
across the sunset and was immediately  {
    }
withdrawn  {
 }
and afterwards a thin rod  {
   }
rose up joint  {
 }
by joint bearing  {
 }
at its apex  {
 }
a circular disk that spun  {
   }
with a wobbling  {
 }
motion  {
 }
what could be going on there most of the spectators had gathered  {
          }
in one or two groups one a little crowd towards woking the other a knot  {
             }
of people in the direction of chobham evidently they shared  {
        }
my mental conflict  {
 }
there were few near me one man i approached he was i perceived a neighbour of mine  {
               }
though i did not know his name  {
     }
and accosted  {
 }
but it was scarcely a time for articulate  {
      }
conversation  {
 }
what ugly  {
 }
brutes  {
 }
he said good god  {
  }
what ugly brutes he repeated  {
   }
this over and over again did you see a man in the pit i said but he made no answer  {
                  }
to that we became  {
  }
silent and stood watching  {
  }
for a time side by side deriving  {
     }
i fancy a certain comfort  {
   }
in one another s company  {
   }
then i shifted  {
 }
my position to a little knoll  {
    }
that gave me the advantage  {
   }
of a yard or more of elevation  {
     }
and when i looked for him presently he was walking towards woking the sunset faded  {
             }
to twilight  {
 }
before anything further happened the crowd far away on the left towards woking seemed to grow and i heard now a faint murmur  {
                     }
from it the little knot of people towards chobham dispersed  {
        }
there was scarcely an intimation  {
   }
of movement from the pit it was this as much as anything that gave people courage  {
              }
and i suppose  {
 }
the new arrivals  {
 }
from woking also  {
 }
helped  {
 }
to restore  {
 }
confidence  {
 }
at any rate  {
 }
as the dusk  {
 }
came on a slow intermittent  {
   }
movement upon the sand pits began a movement that seemed to gather force  {
           }
as the stillness  {
 }
of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken  {
      }
vertical black figures  {
 }
in twos  {
 }
and threes  {
 }
would advance stop watch and advance again spreading  {
      }
out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent  {
        }
that promised  {
 }
to enclose  {
 }
the pit in its attenuated horns  {
    }
i too on my side began to move towards the pit then i saw some cabmen  {
              }
and others had walked boldly  {
   }
into the sand pits and heard the clatter  {
      }
of hoofs  {
 }
and the gride  {
 }
of wheels  {
 }
i saw a lad trundling  {
   }
off the barrow of apples and then within thirty yards of the pit advancing  {
            }
from the direction of horsell i noted  {
     }
a little black knot of men the foremost  {
      }
of whom  {
 }
was waving  {
 }
a white flag  {
 }
this was the deputation  {
  }
there had been a hasty  {
   }
consultation  {

 }
and since the martians were evidently in spite of their repulsive  {
         }
forms  {
 }
intelligent creatures it had been resolved  {
    }
to show them by approaching  {
   }
them with signals  {
 }
that we too were intelligent flutter  {
    }
flutter went the flag first to the right  {
      }
then to the left it was too far for me to recognise  {
          }
anyone there but afterwards i learned that ogilvy stent and henderson were with others in this attempt at communication  {
                 }
this little group had in its advance dragged  {
      }
inward  {
 }
so to speak  {
 }
the circumference of the now almost complete circle of people and a number of dim black figures followed  {
                }
it at discreet  {
 }
distances  {
 }
suddenly there was a flash of light and a quantity  {
        }
of luminous greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs  {
           }
which drove up one after the other straight  {
      }
into the still air this smoke or flame perhaps would be the better  {
           }
word  {
 }
for it was so bright that the deep blue sky overhead  {
         }
and the hazy  {
 }
stretches of brown common towards chertsey set with black pine trees seemed to darken  {
            }
abruptly  {
 }
as these puffs arose  {
  }
and to remain the darker  {
   }
after their dispersal  {
 }
at the same time a faint hissing sound became audible beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at its apex arrested by these phenomena  {
                            }
a little knot of small vertical black shapes  {
      }
upon the black ground as the green smoke arose their faces flashed out pallid  {
            }
green and faded again as it vanished then slowly the hissing passed into a humming into a long loud droning  {
                  }
noise slowly a humped  {
  }
shape rose out of the pit and the ghost  {
       }
of a beam  {
 }
of light seemed to flicker  {
   }
out from it forthwith flashes  {
   }
of actual  {
 }
flame a bright glare  {
  }
leaping  {
 }
from one to another sprang  {
   }
from the scattered group of men it was as if some invisible jet impinged  {
            }
upon them and flashed into white flame it was as if each man were suddenly and momentarily  {
               }
turned to fire then by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering  {
             }
and falling and their supporters  {
   }
turning  {
 }
to run i stood staring not as yet realising  {
       }
that this was death leaping from man to man in that little distant crowd all i felt was that it was something very strange an almost noiseless  {
                         }
and blinding  {
 }
flash of light and a man fell headlong  {
      }
and lay still and as the unseen  {
     }
shaft  {
 }
of heat passed over them pine trees burst into fire and every dry  {
           }
furze  {
 }
bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames  {
        }
and far away towards knaphill  {
   }
i saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden  {
        }
buildings  {
 }
suddenly set alight  {
 }
it was sweeping  {
 }
round swiftly and steadily this flaming death this invisible inevitable  {
        }
sword  {
 }
of heat i perceived it coming towards me by the flashing  {
         }
bushes it touched  {
 }
and was too astounded  {
  }
and stupefied  {
 }
to stir i heard the crackle  {
    }
of fire in the sand pits and the sudden squeal  {
        }
of a horse that was as suddenly stilled  {
      }
then it was as if an invisible yet intensely  {
       }
heated  {
 }
finger  {
 }
were drawn  {
 }
through the heather between me and the martians and all along a curving  {
           }
line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked  {
       }
and crackled  {
 }
something fell with a crash  {
   }
far away to the left where the road from woking station opens out on the common forth with the hissing and humming ceased and the black dome  {
                         }
like object sank  {
 }
slowly out of sight into the pit all this had happened with such swiftness  {
            }
that i had stood motionless  {
   }
dumbfounded  {
	dumbfound :: 12
 }
and dazzled  {
 }
by the flashes of light had that death swept through a full circle it must inevitably  {
              }
have slain  {
 }
me in my surprise but it passed and spared  {
       }
me and left the night about me suddenly dark and unfamiliar the undulating  {
           }
common seemed now dark almost to blackness except where its roadways  {
         }
lay grey and pale  {
  }
under the deep blue sky of the early night it was dark and suddenly void of men overhead the stars were mustering  {
                    }
and in the west the sky was still a pale bright almost greenish blue the tops  {
              }
of the pine trees and the roofs  {
     }
of horsell came out sharp and black against the western afterglow  {
         }
the martians and their appliances  {
   }
were altogether invisible save  {
  }
for that thin mast  {
  }
upon which their restless  {
  }
mirror  {
 }
wobbled  {
 }
patches of bush and isolated  {
   }
trees here and there smoked and glowed still and the houses towards woking station were sending up spires  {
                }
of flame into the stillness of the evening air nothing was changed  {
          }
save for that and a terrible  {
    }
astonishment the little group of black specks  {
     }
with the flag of white had been swept out of existence and the stillness of the evening so it seemed to me had scarcely been broken  {
                        }
it came to me that i was upon this dark common helpless  {
          }
unprotected  {
 }
and alone suddenly like a thing falling upon me from without  {
         }
came fear with an effort  {
   }
i turned and began a stumbling run through the heather the fear i felt was no rational  {
               }
fear but a panic  {
  }
terror not only of the martians but of the dusk and stillness all about me such an extraordinary effect  {
                 }
in unmanning  {
 }
me it had that i ran weeping  {
     }
silently  {
 }
as a child  {
 }
might do once i had turned i did not dare to look back i remember i felt an extraordinary persuasion  {
                  }
that i was being played  {
   }
with that presently when i was upon the very verge  {
        }
of safety  {
 }
this mysterious  {
 }
death as swift as the passage  {
    }
of light would leap after me from the pit about the cylinder and strike  {
            }
me down chapter six the heat ray in the chobham road it is still a matter of wonder how the martians are able  {
                     }
to slay  {
 }
men so swiftly and so silently many think that in some way they are able to generate  {
               }
an intense heat in a chamber  {

much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse  {

a beam of light but no one has absolutely  {

proved these details  {

however it is done it is certain that a beam of heat is the essence  {

and all night long the common from horsell to maybury was deserted and brightly  {
            }
ablaze  {
 }
the news of the massacre  {
   }
probably  {
 }
reached chobham woking and ottershaw about the same time in woking the shops  {
           }
had closed  {
 }
when the tragedy  {
 }
happened and a number of people shop people and so forth attracted  {
          }
by the stories  {
 }
they had heard were walking over the horsell bridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon the common you may imagine the young people brushed  {
                             }
up after the labours  {
  }
of the day and making  {
   }
this novelty  {

as they would make any novelty the excuse  {

for walking together  {

and enjoying  {

a trivial  {

flirtation  {

you may figure to yourself  {
   }
the hum of voices along the road in the gloaming  {
        }
as yet of course few people in woking even knew  {
        }
that the cylinder had opened though poor henderson had sent a messenger  {
          }
on a bicycle to the post  {
    }
office  {
 }
with a special  {
 }
wire to an evening paper as these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open they found little knots  {
                   }
of people talking excitedly  {
  }
and peering  {
 }
at the spinning  {
 }
mirror over the sand pits and the newcomers  {
      }
were no doubt soon infected  {
   }
by the excitement  {
 }
of the occasion by half past eight when the deputation was destroyed  {
          }
there may have been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place besides those who had left the road to approach the martians nearer there were three policemen  {
                             }
too one of whom was mounted  {
    }
doing  {
 }
their best  {
 }
under instructions  {
 }
from stent to keep the people back and deter  {
       }
them from approaching the cylinder there was some booing  {

to and fro flourishing  {

overhead before it descended and smote  {
    }
me out of life i came into the road between the crossroads  {
          }
and horsell and ran along this to the crossroads at last i could go no further i was exhausted  {
                 }
with the violence of my emotion  {
    }
and of my flight and i staggered  {
     }
and fell by the wayside  {
   }
that was near the bridge that crosses  {
     }
the canal  {
 }
by the gasworks  {
	ragwork :: 11
 }
i fell and lay still i must have remained there some time i sat up strangely  {
              }
perplexed  {
 }
for a moment perhaps i could not clearly understand how i came there my terror had fallen from me like a garment  {
                    }
my hat had gone and my collar  {
     }
had burst away from its fastener  {
    }
a few minutes before there had only been three real things before me the immensity of the night and space and nature my own feebleness  {
                       }
and anguish  {
 }
and the near approach of death now it was as if something turned over and the point of view altered abruptly there was no sensible  {
                       }
transition  {
 }
from one state of mind to the other i was immediately the self  {
           }
of every day again a decent  {
    }
ordinary citizen  {
 }
the silent common the impulse of my flight the starting  {
        }
flames were as if they had been in a dream i asked myself had these latter things indeed happened i could not credit  {
                     }
it i rose and walked unsteadily  {
    }
up the steep  {
 }
incline of the bridge my mind was blank  {
      }
wonder my muscles  {
 }
and nerves  {
 }
seemed drained  {
 }
of their strength  {
 }
i dare say i staggered drunkenly  {
    }
a head rose over the arch  {
    }
and the figure of a workman  {
    }
carrying a basket appeared beside him ran a little boy he passed me wishing  {
            }
me good night i was minded  {
    }
to speak to him but did not i answered  {
       }
his greeting  {
 }
with a meaningless  {
 }
mumble  {
 }
and went on over the bridge over the maybury arch a train a billowing  {
            }
tumult of white firelit  {
  }
smoke and a long caterpillar  {
	altarpiece :: 12
   }
of lighted  {
 }
windows went flying south  {
  }
clatter clatter clap  {
 }
rap and it had gone a dim group of people talked  {
         }
in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty  {
         }
little row of gables  {
  }
that was called oriental  {
  }
terrace  {
 }
it was all so real and so familiar and that behind me it was frantic  {
             }
fantastic  {
 }
such things i told myself could not be perhaps i am a man of exceptional  {
             }
moods  {
 }
i do not know how far my experience  {
      }
is common at times i suffer  {
    }
from the strangest sense  {
  }
of detachment  {
 }
from myself and the world about me i seem to watch it all from the outside  {
              }
from somewhere inconceivably  {
 }
remote out of time out of space out of the stress and tragedy of it all this feeling was very strong  {
                   }
upon me that night here was another side to my dream but the trouble was the blank incongruity  {
                }
of this serenity  {
 }
and the swift death flying yonder  {
    }
not two miles away there was a noise of business  {
        }
from the gasworks and the electric  {
    }
lamps  {
 }
were all alight i stopped at the group of people what news from the common said i there were two men and a woman at the gate eh  {
                          }
said one of the men turning what news from the common i said ain  {
            }
t yer  {
	yerk :: 5
	yerd :: 5
	eery :: 5
 }
just been there asked the men people seem fair silly  {
        }
about the common said the woman over the gate what s it all abart  {
	      abetter :: 6
	       aborts :: 6
	        abort :: 7
            }
haven  {
 }
t you heard of the men from mars said i the creatures from mars quite enough  {
              }
said the woman over the gate thenks  {
     }
and all three of them laughed  {
    }
i felt foolish  {
 }
and angry  {
 }
i tried and found i could not tell them what i had seen they laughed again at my broken sentences  {
                  }
you ll  {
 }
hear more yet i said and went on to my home i startled my wife at the doorway  {
                }
so haggard  {
 }
was i i went into the dining  {
     }
room  {
 }
sat down drank  {
 }
some wine  {
 }
and so soon as i could collect  {
     }
myself sufficiently  {
 }
i told her the things i had seen the dinner  {
        }
which was a cold one had already been served  {
       }
and remained neglected  {
 }
on the table while i told my story there is one thing i said to allay  {
              }
the fears i had aroused  {
   }
they are the most sluggish  {
   }
things i ever saw crawl  {
   }
they may keep the pit and kill  {
     }
people who come near them but they cannot  {
      }
get out of it but the horror of them don t dear  {
          }
said my wife knitting  {
  }
her brows  {
 }
and putting  {
 }
her hand on mine poor ogilvy i said to think he may be lying dead there my wife at least did not find my experience incredible when i saw how deadly  {
                             }
white her face was i ceased abruptly they may come here she said again and again i pressed  {
                }
her to take wine and tried to reassure  {
      }
her they can scarcely move i said i began to comfort her and myself by repeating  {
              }
all that ogilvy had told me of the impossibility  {
       }
of the martians establishing  {
  }
themselves on the earth in particular  {
    }
i laid  {
 }
stress on the gravitational difficulty  {
   }
on the surface of the earth the force of gravity  {
        }
is three times what it is on the surface of mars a martian therefore would weigh  {
              }
three times more than on mars albeit  {
     }
his muscular  {
 }
strength would be the same his own body would be a cope  {
          }
of lead to him that indeed was the general opinion  {
        }
both the times and the daily telegraph for instance  {
       }
insisted  {
 }
on it the next morning and both overlooked  {
      }
just as i did two obvious  {
    }
modifying  {
 }
influences  {
 }
the atmosphere of the earth we now know contains  {
       }
far more oxygen  {
 }
or far less argon  {
  }
whichever  {
 }
way one likes  {
 }
to put it than does  {
   }
mars the invigorating  {
	invigorate :: 14
	invigorant :: 13
	inveterate :: 11
 }
influences of this excess of oxygen upon the martians indisputably  {
        }
did much to counterbalance  {
	counter :: 14
	countable :: 14
	counterbid :: 14
  }
the increased weight  {
 }
of their bodies  {
 }
and in the second place we all overlooked the fact that such mechanical  {
           }
intelligence as the martian possessed  {
   }
was quite able to dispense  {
   }
with muscular exertion  {
 }
at a pinch  {
 }
but i did not consider these points at the time and so my reasoning  {
            }
was dead against the chances of the invaders  {
      }
with wine and food  {
  }
the confidence of my own table and the necessity of reassuring  {
         }
my wife i grew  {
  }
by insensible degrees  {
 }
courageous  {
 }
and secure  {
 }
they have done a foolish thing said i fingering  {
       }
my wineglass  {
 }
they are dangerous  {
 }
because no doubt they are mad with terror perhaps they expected to find no living things certainly no intelligent living things a shell  {
                     }
in the pit said i if the worst  {
      }
comes  {
 }
to the worst will  {
  }
kill them all the intense excitement of the events  {
       }
had no doubt left my perceptive  {
    }
powers in a state of erethism  {
    }
i remember that dinner table with extraordinary vividness  {
      }
even now my dear wife s sweet anxious  {
      }
face peering at me from under the pink  {
      }
lamp shade  {
 }
the white cloth  {
 }
with its silver and glass table furniture  {
     }

had many little luxuries  {
  }
the crimson purple  {
 }
wine in my glass are photographically  {
    }
distinct at the end of it i sat tempering  {
       }
nuts  {
 }
with a cigarette  {
 }
regretting  {
 }
ogilvy s rashness  {
 }
and denouncing  {
 }
the shortsighted  {
 }
timidity  {
 }
of the martians so some respectable  {
    }
dodo in the mauritius  {
  }
might have lorded  {
 }
it in his nest  {
  }
and discussed  {
 }
the arrival of that shipful  {
   }
of pitiless sailors  {
 }
in want of animal food we will peck  {
      }
them to death tomorrow  {
  }
my dear i did not know it but that was the last civilised  {
           }
dinner i was to eat  {
   }
for very many strange and terrible days chapter eight friday  {
        }
night the most extraordinary thing to my mind of all the strange and wonderful things that happened upon that friday was the dovetailing  {
                     }
of the commonplace  {
 }
habits of our social  {
  }
order with the first beginnings  {
   }
of the series of events that was to topple that social order headlong if on friday night you had taken a pair  {
                    }
of compasses  {
 }
and drawn a circle with a radius  {
     }
of five miles round the woking sand pits i doubt if you would have had one human being outside it unless  {
                   }
it were some relation  {
  }
of stent or of the three or four cyclists or london people lying dead on the common whose  {
                }
emotions  {
 }
or habits were at all affected  {
    }
by the new comers many people had heard of the cylinder of course and talked about it in their leisure  {
                  }
but it certainly did not make the sensation  {
      }
that an ultimatum  {
 }
to germany  {
	german :: 12
 }
would have done in london that night poor henderson s telegram  {
         }
describing  {
 }
the gradual unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard  {
          }
and his evening paper after wiring  {
    }
for authentication  {
 }
from him and receiving  {
  }
no reply  {
 }
the man was killed  {
  }
decided  {
 }
not to print  {
 }
a special edition even within the five mile circle the great majority  {
          }
of people were inert  {
  }
i have already described the behaviour  {
    }
of the men and women to whom i spoke all over the district  {
           }
people were dining and supping  {
   }
working  {
 }
men were gardening  {
 }
after the labours of the day children  {
     }
were being put to bed young people were wandering  {
       }
through the lanes  {
 }
love making students  {
 }
sat over their books  {
  }
maybe  {
 }
there was a murmur in the village  {
     }
streets  {
 }
a novel and dominant  {
  }
topic  {
 }
in the public houses and here and there a messenger or even an eye witness  {
             }
of the later  {
 }
occurrences  {
 }
caused a whirl of excitement a shouting  {
     }
and a running to and fro but for the most part the daily routine  {
            }
of working eating  {
 }
drinking  {
 }
sleeping went on as it had done for countless years as though no planet mars existed  {
              }
in the sky even at woking station and horsell and chobham that was the case in woking junction  {
                }
until a late hour trains were stopping  {
     }
and going on others were shunting on the sidings  {
       }
passengers  {
 }
were alighting  {
 }
and waiting  {
 }
and everything was proceeding  {
  }
in the most ordinary way a boy from the town trenching  {
         }
on smith  {
 }
s monopoly  {
 }
was selling  {
 }
papers with the afternoon s news the ringing impact of trucks  {
         }
the sharp whistle  {
 }
of the engines  {
 }
from the junction mingled  {
  }
with their shouts of men from mars excited men came into the station about nine o clock with incredible tidings  {
                  }
and caused no more disturbance than drunkards  {
     }
might have done people rattling  {
   }
londonwards  {
 }
peered  {
 }
into the darkness outside the carriage windows and saw only a rare  {
          }
flickering  {
 }
vanishing  {
 }
spark dance  {
 }
up from the direction of horsell a red glow and a thin veil  {
           }
of smoke driving  {
 }
across the stars and thought that nothing more serious than a heath fire was happening it was only round the edge of the common that any disturbance was perceptible  {
                           }
there were half a dozen  {
   }
villas  {
 }
burning on the woking border  {
   }
there were lights in all the houses on the common side of the three villages  {
             }
and the people there kept awake  {
    }
till dawn a curious crowd lingered  {
    }
restlessly  {
 }
people coming and going but the crowd remaining  {
      }
both on the chobham and horsell bridges  {
     }
one or two adventurous  {
  }
souls it was afterwards found went into the darkness and crawled  {
         }
quite near the martians but they never returned for now and again a light ray like the beam of a warship  {
                   }
s searchlight  {
 }
swept the common and the heat ray was ready to follow save for such that big area of common was silent and desolate  {
                     }
and the charred bodies lay about on it all night under the stars and all the next day a noise of hammering  {
                    }
from the pit was heard by many people so you have the state of things on friday night in the centre  {
                   }
sticking  {
 }
into the skin of our old planet earth like a poisoned  {
         }
dart  {
 }
was this cylinder but the poison was scarcely working yet around it was a patch of silent common smouldering  {
                 }
in places  {
 }
and with a few dark dimly seen objects  {
      }
lying in contorted  {
 }
attitudes  {
 }
here and there here and there was a burning bush or tree beyond was a fringe  {
              }
of excitement and farther  {
  }
than that fringe the inflammation  {

had not crept  {
 }
as yet in the rest of the world the stream of life still flowed  {
            }
as it had flowed for immemorial  {
    }
years the fever  {
 }
of war that would presently clog  {
    }
vein  {
 }
and artery  {
 }
deaden  {
 }
nerve and destroy brain  {
  }
had still to develop all night long the martians were hammering and stirring sleepless  {
            }
indefatigable  {
 }
at work upon the machines  {
   }
they were making ready and ever and again a puff of greenish white smoke whirled  {
             }
up to the starlit  {
  }
sky about eleven a company of soldiers came through horsell and deployed  {
          }
along the edge of the common to form a cordon  {
        }
later a second company marched  {
   }
through chobham to deploy on the north  {
     }
side of the common several officers  {
    }
from the inkerman  {
 }
barracks had been on the common earlier  {
     }
in the day and one major eden  {
	denned :: 4
	 deend :: 4
	  edns :: 4
	   end :: 4
	    ed :: 4
     }
was reported  {
 }
to be missing  {
 }
the colonel  {
 }
of the regiment  {
 }
came to the chobham bridge and was busy questioning  {

were certainly alive  {
 }
to the seriousness  {

	senior :: 10
 }
of the business about eleven the next morning s papers were able to say a squadron  {
              }
of hussars  {
 }
two maxims  {
 }
and about four hundred men of the cardigan  {
      }
regiment started from aldershot  {
  }
a few seconds after midnight the crowd in the chertsey road woking saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods  {
                    }
to the northwest  {
 }
it had a greenish colour and caused a silent brightness like summer  {
          }
lightning  {
 }
this was the second cylinder chapter nine the fighting  {
       }
begins  {
 }
saturday  {
 }
lives  {
 }
in my memory  {
 }
as a day of suspense  {
   }
it was a day of lassitude  {
    }
too hot and close with i am told a rapidly  {
        }
fluctuating barometer  {
 }
i had slept  {
 }
but little though my wife had succeeded  {
     }
in sleeping and i rose early i went into my garden before breakfast and stood listening  {
              }
but towards the common there was nothing stirring but a lark  {
         }
the milkman  {
 }
came as usual  {
 }
i heard the rattle  {
  }
of his chariot  {
 }
and i went round to the side gate to ask the latest  {
          }
news he told me that during the night the martians had been surrounded  {
           }
by troops  {
 }
and that guns  {
 }
were expected then a familiar reassuring note i heard a train running towards woking they aren  {
              }
t to be killed said the milkman if that can possibly be avoided  {
           }
i saw my neighbour gardening chatted  {
    }
with him for a time and then strolled  {
      }
in to breakfast it was a most unexceptional  {
      }
morning my neighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture  {
            }
or to destroy the martians during the day it s a pity  {
          }
they make themselves so unapproachable  {
   }
he said it would be curious to know how they live on another planet we might learn a thing or two he came up to the fence  {
                         }
and extended  {
 }
a handful  {
 }
of strawberries  {
	strawiest :: 11
	strawier :: 12
	strawberry :: 12
 }
for his gardening was as generous  {
    }
as it was enthusiastic  {
	enthusiasm :: 14
	enthusiast :: 14
  }
at the same time he told me of the burning of the pine woods about the byfleet  {
               }
golf links  {
 }
they say said he that there s another of those blessed  {
         }
things fallen there number two but one s enough surely this lot  {
          }
ll cost the insurance  {
  }
people a pretty penny  {
  }
before everything s settled  {
  }
he laughed with an air of the greatest good humour  {
        }
as he said this the woods he said were still burning and pointed out a haze  {
              }
of smoke to me they will be hot under foot  {
        }
for days on account of the thick soil  {
      }
of pine needles  {
 }
and turf he said and then grew serious over poor ogilvy after breakfast instead of working i decided to walk down towards the common under the railway bridge i found a group of soldiers sappers  {
                                 }
i think men in small round caps  {
     }
dirty  {
 }
red jackets  {
 }
unbuttoned  {
 }
and showing their blue shirts  {
   }
dark trousers  {
 }
and boots  {
 }
coming to the calf  {
  }
they told me no one was allowed  {
     }
over the canal and looking along the road towards the bridge i saw one of the cardigan men standing sentinel  {
                  }
there i talked with these soldiers for a time i told them of my sight of the martians on the previous  {
                   }
evening none of them had seen the martians and they had but the vaguest ideas of them so that they plied  {
                   }
me with questions  {
 }
they said that they did not know who had authorised  {
        }
the movements of the troops their idea was that a dispute  {
         }
had arisen  {
 }
at the horse guards  {
  }
the ordinary sapper is a great deal better educated  {
       }
than the common soldier and they discussed the peculiar conditions  {
        }
of the possible fight with some acuteness  {
     }
i described the heat ray to them and they began to argue  {
          }
among themselves crawl up under cover and rush em say i said one get aht  {
             }
said another what s cover against this ere eat sticks  {
        }

      }
dark man smoking  {
 }
a pipe  {
 }
i repeated my description octopuses  {
   }

       }
said the first speaker there ain t no time do it in a rush that s my tip  {
                }
and do it at once so they discussed it after a while i left them and went on to the railway station to get as many morning papers as i could but i will not weary  {
                                  }
the reader with a description of that long morning and of the longer  {
           }
afternoon i did not succeed in getting a glimpse of the common for even horsell and chobham church  {
                }
towers  {
 }
were in the hands of the military authorities the soldiers i addressed  {
          }
didn  {
 }
t know anything the officers were mysterious as well as busy i found people in the town quite secure again in the presence  {
                     }
of the military and i heard for the first time from marshall  {

the tobacconist  {
 }
that his son was among the dead on the common the soldiers had made the people on the outskirts  {
                 }
of horsell lock  {
 }
up and leave their houses i got back to lunch  {
        }
about two very tired for as i have said the day was extremely  {
           }
hot and dull and in order to refresh  {
      }
myself i took a cold bath  {
    }
in the afternoon about half past four i went up to the railway station to get an evening paper for the morning papers had contained only a very inaccurate  {
                           }
description of the killing of stent henderson ogilvy and the others but there was little i didn t know the martians did not show an inch of themselves they seemed busy in their pit and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous  {
                                           }
streamer of smoke apparently  {
  }
they were busy getting ready for a struggle fresh  {
       }
attempts  {
 }
have been made to signal but without success  {
      }
was the stereotyped  {
	stereotype :: 12
 }
formula  {
 }
of the papers a sapper told me it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole the martians took as much notice of such advances  {
                              }
as we should of the lowing  {
    }
of a cow  {
 }
i must confess  {
 }
the sight of all this armament  {
    }
all this preparation greatly excited me my imagination  {
	imaginist :: 9
	amating :: 9

	  imago :: 9
      }
became belligerent  {
 }
and defeated  {
 }
the invaders in a dozen  {
   }
striking  {
 }
ways something of my schoolboy  {
   }
dreams  {
 }
of battle and heroism  {
  }
came back it hardly  {
  }
seemed a fair fight to me at that time they seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs  {
                }
about three o clock there began the thud of a gun at measured  {
           }
intervals  {
 }
from chertsey or addlestone  {
	adolescent :: 12
  }
i learned that the smouldering pine wood into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled  {
               }
in the hope of destroying  {
   }
that object before it opened it was only about five however that a field gun reached chobham for use against the first body of martians about six in the evening as i sat at tea with my wife in the summerhouse  {

talking vigorously  {
 }
about the battle that was lowering  {
    }
upon us i heard a muffled detonation  {
     }
from the common and immediately after a gust  {
      }
of firing close on the heels  {
    }
of that came a violent rattling crash quite close to us that shook  {
           }
the ground and starting out upon the lawn  {
      }
i saw the tops of the trees about the oriental college  {
         }
burst into smoky  {
 }
red flame and the tower of the little church beside it slide  {
          }
down into ruin the pinnacle  {
   }
of the mosque  {
 }
had vanished and the roof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred ton  {
              }
gun had been at work upon it one of our chimneys  {
         }
cracked  {
 }
as if a shot had hit  {
    }
it flew  {
 }
and a piece of it came clattering  {
     }
down the tiles  {
 }
and made a heap of broken red fragments upon the flower  {
         }
bed by my study window i and my wife stood amazed  {
         }
then i realised that the crest  {
    }
of maybury hill  {
 }
must be within range  {
  }
of the martians heat ray now that the college was cleared  {
         }
out of the way at that i gripped my wife s arm and without ceremony  {
             }
ran her out into the road then i fetched  {
       }
out the servant  {
 }
telling  {
 }
her i would go upstairs  {
   }
myself for the box  {
  }
she was clamouring  {
 }
for we can t possibly stay  {
    }
here i said and as i spoke the firing reopened  {
        }
for a moment upon the common but where are we to go said my wife in terror i thought perplexed then i remembered  {
                     }
her cousins  {

 }
leatherhead i shouted above the sudden noise she looked away from me downhill  {
           }
the people were coming out of their houses astonished how are we to get to leatherhead she said down the hill i saw a bevy  {
                       }
of hussars ride under the railway bridge three galloped  {
       }
through the open gates of the oriental college two others dismounted  {
         }
and began running from house to house the sun shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the trees seemed blood  {
                      }
red and threw  {
 }
an unfamiliar lurid  {
 }
light upon everything stop here said i you are safe here and i started off at once for the spotted  {
                  }
dog  {
 }
for i knew the landlord  {
   }
had a horse and dog cart i ran for i perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the hill would be moving i found him in his bar quite unaware  {
                               }
of what was going on behind his house a man stood with his back to me talking to him i must have a pound  {
                      }
said the landlord and i ve no one to drive it i ll give you two said i over the stranger  {
                   }
s shoulder what for and i ll bring it back by midnight i said lord said the landlord what s the hurry i m selling my bit  {
                         }
of a pig  {
 }
two pounds  {
 }
and you bring it back what s going on now i explained hastily  {
           }
that i had to leave my home and so secured  {
        }
the dog cart at the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent  {
             }
that the landlord should leave his i took care  {
       }
to have the cart there and then drove it off down the road and leaving it in charge  {
                }
of my wife and servant rushed into my house and packed  {
         }
a few valuables  {
 }
such plate  {
 }
as we had and so forth the beech trees below the house were burning while i did this and the palings up the road glowed red while i was occupied in this way one of the dismounted hussars came running up he was going from house to house warning  {
                                               }
people to leave he was going on as i came out of my front  {
            }
door lugging  {
 }
my treasures  {
 }
done up in a tablecloth  {
   }
i shouted after him what news he turned stared  {
       }
bawled  {
 }
something about crawling  {
 }
out in a thing like a dish  {
     }
cover and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest a sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a moment i ran to my neighbour s door and rapped to satisfy  {
                                     }
myself of what i already knew that his wife had gone to london with him and had locked  {
                }
up their house i went in again according  {
      }
to my promise to get my servant s box lugged  {
        }
it out clapped  {
 }
it beside her on the tail  {
    }
of the dog cart and then caught the reins  {
       }
and jumped  {
 }
up into the driver  {
  }
s seat  {
 }
beside my wife in another moment we were clear of the smoke and noise and spanking  {
              }
down the opposite  {
 }
slope  {
 }
of maybury hill towards old woking in front was a quiet sunny  {
          }
landscape  {
 }
a wheat  {
 }
field ahead  {
 }
on either side of the road and the maybury inn  {
        }
with its swinging  {
 }
sign i saw the doctor  {
   }
s cart ahead of me at the bottom  {
      }
of the hill i turned my head to look at the hillside  {
          }
i was leaving thick streamers of black smoke shot with threads  {
         }
of red fire were driving up into the still air and throwing dark shadows  {
            }
upon the green treetops  {
  }
eastward the smoke already extended far away to the east and west to the byfleet pine woods eastward and to woking on the west the road was dotted with people running towards us and very faint now but very distinct through the hot quiet air one heard the whirr  {
                                               }
of a machine gun that was presently stilled and an intermittent cracking  {
          }
of rifles  {
 }
apparently the martians were setting fire to everything within range of their heat ray i am not an expert  {
                 }
driver and i had immediately to turn my attention  {
       }
to the horse when i looked back again the second hill had hidden the black smoke i slashed  {
                }
the horse with the whip and gave him a loose  {
        }
rein until woking and send lay between us and that quivering tumult i overtook  {
            }
and passed the doctor between woking and send chapter ten in the storm leatherhead is about twelve miles from maybury hill the scent  {
                     }
of hay  {
 }
was in the air through the lush  {
     }
meadows  {
 }
beyond pyrford  {
 }
and the hedges on either side were sweet and gay  {
        }
with multitudes  {
 }
of dog roses  {
 }
the heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down maybury hill ceased as abruptly as it began leaving the evening very peaceful  {
                       }
and still we got to leatherhead without misadventure  {
      }
about nine o clock and the horse had an hour s rest while i took supper  {
              }
with my cousins and commended  {
   }
my wife to their care my wife was curiously  {
       }
silent throughout  {
 }
the drive and seemed oppressed  {
   }
with forebodings  {
	foreboding :: 17
 }
of evil  {
 }
i talked to her reassuringly  {
   }
pointing  {
 }
out that the martians were tied  {
    }
to the pit by sheer  {
   }
heaviness and at the utmost  {
   }
could but crawl a little out of it but she answered only in monosyllables  {
            }
had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper  {
        }
she would i think have urged  {
    }
me to stay in leatherhead that night would that i had her face i remember was very white as we parted  {
                   }
for my own part i had been feverishly  {
      }
excited all day something very like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community  {
              }
had got into my blood and in my heart i was not so very sorry  {
             }
that i had to return to maybury that night i was even afraid  {
           }
that that last fusillade  {
  }
i had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from mars i can best express my state of mind by saying that i wanted to be in at the death it was nearly eleven when i started to return the night was unexpectedly  {
                                          }
dark to me walking out of the lighted passage of my cousins house it seemed indeed black and it was as hot and close as the day overhead the clouds were driving fast albeit not a breath stirred  {
                                    }
the shrubs  {
 }
about us my cousins man lit both lamps happily  {
       }
i knew the road intimately  {
   }
my wife stood in the light of the doorway and watched me until i jumped up into the dog cart then abruptly she turned and went in leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good hap i was a little depressed  {
                                        }
at first with the contagion  {
   }
of my wife s fears but very soon my thoughts  {
        }
reverted  {
 }
to the martians at that time i was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evening s fighting i did not know even the circumstances  {
                          }
that had precipitated  {

the conflict as i came through ockham  {
     }
for that was the way i returned and not through send and old woking i saw along the western horizon  {
                  }
a blood red glow which as i drew nearer crept slowly up the sky the driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm  {
	            thunders :: 16
                   }
mingled there with masses  {
  }
of black and red smoke ripley  {
	ripely :: 10
    }
street was deserted and except for a lighted window or so the village showed not a sign of life but i narrowly escaped  {
                     }
an accident  {
 }
at the corner of the road to pyrford where a knot of people stood with their backs  {
               }
to me they said nothing to me as i passed i do not know what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill nor do i know if the silent houses i passed on my way were sleeping securely  {
                                      }
or deserted and empty or harassed  {
    }
and watching against the terror of the night from ripley until i came through pyrford i was in the valley  {
                  }
of the wey and the red glare was hidden from me as i ascended  {
            }
the little hill beyond pyrford church the glare came into view again and the trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that was upon me then i heard midnight pealing  {
                                }
out from pyrford church behind me and then came the silhouette  {
         }
of maybury hill with its tree tops and roofs black and sharp against the red even as i beheld  {
                 }
this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and showed the distant woods towards addlestone i felt a tug  {
                   }
at the reins i saw that the driving clouds had been pierced  {
          }
as it were by a thread of green fire suddenly lighting their confusion and falling into the field to my left it was the third falling star close on its apparition  {
                             }
and blindingly  {

 }
violet  {
 }
by contrast  {
 }
danced  {
 }
out the first lightning of the gathering storm and the thunder burst like a rocket  {
             }
overhead the horse took the bit between his teeth  {
       }
and bolted a moderate  {
  }
incline runs towards the foot of maybury hill and down this we clattered  {
           }
once the lightning had begun it went on in as rapid a succession  {
           }
of flashes as i have ever seen the thunderclaps  {
       }
treading  {
 }
one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling  {
         }
accompaniment  {
 }
sounded  {
 }
more like the working of a gigantic  {
     }
electric machine than the usual detonating  {
    }
reverberations  {
 }
the flickering light was blinding and confusing  {
     }
and a thin hail  {
  }
smote gustily  {
	lustily :: 12
 }
at my face as i drove down the slope at first i regarded little but the road before me and then abruptly my attention was arrested by something that was moving rapidly down the opposite slope of maybury hill at first i took it for the wet roof of a house but one flash following  {
                                                     }
another showed it to be in swift rolling  {
      }
movement it was an elusive  {
   }
vision  {
 }
a moment of bewildering  {
  }
darkness and then in a flash like daylight  {
      }
the red masses of the orphanage  {
    }
near the crest of the hill the green tops of the pine trees and this problematical  {
              }
object came out clear and sharp and bright and this thing i saw how can i describe it a monstrous tripod  {
                   }
higher than many houses striding  {
   }
over the young pine trees and smashing them aside  {
       }
in its career  {
 }
a walking engine of glittering  {
   }
metal striding now across the heather articulate ropes  {
      }
of steel  {
 }
dangling from it and the clattering tumult of its passage mingling  {
         }
with the riot  {
 }
of the thunder a flash and it came out vividly  {
        }
heeling  {
 }
over one way with two feet in the air to vanish and reappear  {
           }
almost instantly  {
 }
as it seemed with the next flash a hundred yards nearer can you imagine a milking  {
              }
stool  {
 }
tilted  {
 }
and bowled  {
 }
violently along the ground that was the impression those instant flashes gave but instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery  {
                       }
on a tripod stand then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted as brittle  {
                 }
reeds  {
 }
are parted by a man thrusting  {
    }
through them they were snapped  {
   }
off and driven  {
 }
headlong and a second huge tripod appeared rushing as it seemed headlong towards me and i was galloping hard to meet it at the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether not stopping to look again i wrenched  {
                                      }
the horse s head hard round to the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled  {
                }
over upon the horse the shafts  {
    }
smashed  {
 }
noisily  {
 }
and i was flung sideways  {
   }
and fell heavily  {
 }
into a shallow  {
 }
pool  {
 }
of water i crawled out almost immediately and crouched  {
       }
my feet still in the water under a clump  {
       }
of furze  {
 }
the horse lay motionless his neck was broken poor brute and by the lightning flashes i saw the black bulk of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still spinning slowly in another moment the colossal mechanism  {
                                      }
went striding by me and passed uphill  {
     }
towards pyrford seen nearer the thing was incredibly strange for it was no mere  {
            }
insensate  {
 }
machine driving on its way machine it was with a ringing metallic  {
          }
pace and long flexible  {
  }
glittering tentacles one of which gripped a young pine tree swinging and rattling about its strange body it picked  {
                 }
its road as it went striding along and the brazen  {
        }
hood  {
 }
that surmounted  {
 }
it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion  {
       }
of a head looking about behind the main  {
      }
body was a huge mass of white metal like a gigantic fisherman  {
          }
s basket and puffs of green smoke squirted out from the joints  {
          }
of the limbs  {
 }
as the monster swept by me and in an instant it was gone so much i saw then all vaguely  {
                  }
for the flickering of the lightning in blinding highlights  {
       }
and dense black shadows as it passed it set up an exultant  {
          }
deafening  {
 }
howl  {
 }
that drowned  {
 }
the thunder aloo  {

 }
aloo and in another minute it was with its companion  {
        }
half a mile away stooping  {
   }
over something in the field i have no doubt this thing in the field was the third of the ten cylinders  {
                   }
they had fired at us from mars for some minutes i lay there in the rain and darkness watching by the intermittent light these monstrous beings  {
                        }
of metal moving about in the distance over the hedge tops a thin hail was now beginning and as it came and went their figures grew misty  {
                         }
and then flashed into clearness again now and then came a gap  {
          }
in the lightning and the night swallowed  {
     }
them up i was soaked  {
   }
with hail above and puddle  {
   }
water below it was some time before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to a drier  {
                  }
position or think at all of my imminent  {
      }
peril  {
 }
not far from me was a little one roomed  {
       }
squatter  {
 }
s hut  {
 }
of wood surrounded by a patch of potato  {
      }
garden i struggled  {
 }
to my feet at last and crouching  {
     }
and making use of every chance of cover i made a run for this i hammered  {
              }
at the door but i could not make the people hear if there were any people inside and after a time i desisted  {
                     }
and availing  {
 }
myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way succeeded in crawling unobserved  {
             }
by these monstrous machines into the pine woods towards maybury under cover of this i pushed on wet and shivering  {
                  }
now towards my own house i walked among the trees trying to find the footpath  {
             }
it was very dark indeed in the wood for the lightning was now becoming infrequent  {
             }
and the hail which was pouring  {
    }
down in a torrent  {
  }
fell in columns  {
 }
through the gaps  {
 }
in the heavy foliage  {
  }
if i had fully  {
  }
realised the meaning of all the things i had seen i should have immediately worked  {
             }
my way round through byfleet to street cobham  {
      }
and so gone back to rejoin  {
    }
my wife at leatherhead but that night the strangeness of things about me and my physical wretchedness  {
               }
prevented  {
 }
me for i was bruised  {
   }
weary wet to the skin deafened  {
    }
and blinded by the storm i had a vague idea of going on to my own house and that was as much motive  {
                     }
as i had i staggered through the trees fell into a ditch and bruised my knees  {
              }
against a plank  {
 }
and finally  {
 }
splashed  {
 }
out into the lane that ran down from the college arms i say splashed for the storm water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy  {
                          }
torrent there in the darkness a man blundered into me and sent me reeling  {
            }
back he gave a cry of terror sprang sideways and rushed on before i could gather my wits  {
                }
sufficiently to speak to him so heavy was the stress of the storm just at this place that i had the hardest  {
                    }
task  {
 }
to win my way up the hill i went close up to the fence on the left and worked my way along its palings near the top i stumbled  {
                           }
upon something soft and by a flash of lightning saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth  {
                }
and a pair of boots before i could distinguish  {
       }
clearly how the man lay the flicker of light had passed i stood over him waiting for the next flash when it came i saw that he was a sturdy  {
                            }
man cheaply  {
 }
but not shabbily  {
 }
dressed his head was bent  {
   }
under his body and he lay crumpled  {
     }
up close to the fence as though he had been flung violently against it overcoming  {
             }
the repugnance  {
 }
natural to one who had never before touched a dead body i stooped  {
           }
and turned him over to feel for his heart he was quite dead apparently his neck had been broken the lightning flashed for a third time and his face leaped  {
                            }
upon me i sprang to my feet it was the landlord of the spotted dog whose conveyance  {
               }
i had taken i stepped  {
   }
over him gingerly  {
 }
and pushed on up the hill i made my way by the police station and the college arms towards my own house nothing was burning on the hillside though from the common there still came a red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy  {
                                          }
smoke beating  {
 }
up against the drenching  {
  }
hail so far as i could see by the flashes the houses about me were mostly  {
              }
uninjured  {
 }
by the college arms a dark heap lay in the road down the road towards maybury bridge there were voices and the sound of feet but i had not the courage to shout or to go to them i let myself in with my latchkey  {
                                           }
closed locked and bolted the door staggered to the foot of the staircase  {
           }
and sat down my imagination was full of those striding metallic monsters  {
          }
and of the dead body smashed against the fence i crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall  {
                     }
shivering violently chapter eleven at the window i have already said that my storms  {
            }
of emotion have a trick  {
   }
of exhausting  {
 }
themselves after a time i discovered that i was cold and wet and with little pools  {
              }
of water about me on the stair carpet  {
      }
i got up almost mechanically  {
	mechanical :: 14
	mechanic :: 13
   }
went into the dining room and drank some whiskey  {
       }
and then i was moved to change my clothes  {
       }
after i had done that i went upstairs to my study but why i did so i do not know the window of my study looks over the trees and the railway towards horsell common in the hurry of our departure  {
                                       }
this window had been left open the passage was dark and by contrast with the picture  {
              }
the window frame enclosed  {
  }
the side of the room seemed impenetrably  {
     }
dark i stopped short in the doorway the thunderstorm had passed the towers of the oriental college and the pine trees about it had gone and very far away lit by a vivid red glare the common about the sand pits was visible across the light huge black shapes grotesque  {
                                                }
and strange moved busily  {
  }
to and fro it seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on fire a broad hillside set with minute tongues  {
                      }
of flame swaying  {
 }
and writhing with the gusts  {
   }
of the dying  {
 }
storm and throwing a red reflection  {
    }
upon the cloud scud  {
  }
above every now and then a haze  {
     }
of smoke from some nearer conflagration  {
    }
drove across the window and hid the martian shapes i could not see what they were doing nor the clear form of them nor recognise the black objects they were busied upon neither  {
                               }
could i see the nearer fire though the reflections  {
	reflection :: 17
       }
of it danced on the wall and ceiling  {
      }
of the study a sharp resinous  {
    }
tang  {
 }
of burning was in the air i closed the door noiselessly  {
	    norsel :: 9
	    noises :: 9
	    noised :: 9
	 noisomely :: 9

         }
and crept towards the window as i did so the view opened out until on the one hand it reached to the houses about woking station and on the other to the charred and blackened pine woods of byfleet there was a light down below the hill on the railway near the arch and several of the houses along the maybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins  {
                                                                     }
the light upon the railway puzzled  {
    }
me at first there were a black heap and a vivid glare and to the right of that a row of yellow oblongs  {
                     }
then i perceived this was a wrecked  {
     }
train the fore part smashed and on fire the hinder  {
        }
carriages  {
 }
still upon the rails  {
  }
between these three main centres  {
   }
of light the houses the train and the burning county  {
        }
towards chobham stretched  {
 }
irregular patches of dark country broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and smoking ground it was the strangest spectacle  {
                    }
that black expanse  {
 }
set with fire it reminded  {
   }
me more than anything else  {
   }
of the potteries  {
 }
at night at first i could distinguish no people at all though i peered intently  {
             }
for them later i saw against the light of woking station a number of black figures hurrying one after the other across the line and this was the little world in which i had been living securely for years this fiery  {
                                       }
chaos  {
 }
what had happened in the last seven hours i still did not know nor did i know though i was beginning to guess  {
                     }
the relation between these mechanical colossi  {
    }
and the sluggish lumps  {
  }
i had seen disgorged  {
  }
from the cylinder with a queer feeling of impersonal  {
       }
interest  {
 }
i turned my desk  {
  }
chair  {
 }
to the window sat down and stared at the blackened country and particularly  {
           }
at the three gigantic black things that were going to and fro in the glare about the sand pits they seemed amazingly  {
                    }
busy i began to ask myself what they could be were they intelligent mechanisms  {
            }
such a thing i felt was impossible or did a martian sit within each ruling  {
             }
directing  {
 }
using  {
 }
much as a man s brain sits  {
     }
and rules  {
 }
in his body i began to compare the things to human machines to ask myself for the first time in my life how an ironclad  {
                       }
or a steam engine would seem to an intelligent lower animal the storm had left the sky clear and over the smoke of the burning land the little fading  {
                           }
pinpoint  {
 }
of mars was dropping into the west when a soldier came into my garden i heard a slight scraping  {
                 }
at the fence and rousing  {
   }
myself from the lethargy  {
  }
that had fallen upon me i looked down and saw him dimly clambering  {
           }
over the palings at the sight of another human being my torpor  {
          }
passed and i leaned  {
  }
out of the window eagerly  {
   }
hist  {
 }
said i in a whisper  {
   }
he stopped astride  {
 }
of the fence in doubt then he came over and across the lawn to the corner of the house he bent down and stepped softly  {
                       }
who s there he said also whispering  {
     }
standing under the window and peering up where are you going i asked god knows  {
             }
are you trying to hide  {
   }
that s it come into the house i said i went down unfastened  {
           }
the door and let him in and locked the door again i could not see his face he was hatless  {
                  }
and his coat  {
 }
was unbuttoned my god he said as i drew him in what has happened i asked what hasn  {
                }
t in the obscurity  {
  }
i could see he made a gesture  {
     }
of despair  {
 }
they wiped  {
 }
us out simply wiped us out he repeated again and again he followed me almost mechanically into the dining room take some whiskey i said pouring out a stiff  {
                           }
dose  {
 }
he drank it then abruptly he sat down before the table put his head on his arms and began to sob and weep like a little boy in a perfect passion of emotion while i with a curious forgetfulness  {
                                     }
of my own recent despair stood beside him wondering  {
       }
it was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my questions and then he answered perplexingly  {
	         perplexing :: 14
                  }
and brokenly  {
 }
he was a driver in the artillery  {
     }
and had only come into action about seven at that time firing was going on across the common and it was said the first party of martians were crawling slowly towards their second cylinder under cover of a metal shield  {
                                      }
later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first of the fighting machines i had seen the gun he drove had been unlimbered  {
                        }
near horsell in order to command  {
    }
the sand pits and its arrival it was that had precipitated the action as the limber  {
              }
gunners  {
 }
went to the rear  {
  }
his horse trod  {
 }
in a rabbit hole and came down throwing him into a depression  {
          }
of the ground at the same moment the gun exploded  {
        }
behind him the ammunition  {
  }
blew  {
 }
up there was fire all about him and he found himself lying under a heap of charred dead men and dead horses i lay still he said scared  {
                          }
out of my wits with the fore quarter of a horse atop  {
          }
of me we d been wiped out and the smell  {
        }
good god like burnt meat  {
   }
i was hurt  {
 }
across the back by the fall of the horse and there i had to lie  {
             }
until i felt better just like parade  {
     }
it had been a minute before then stumble bang  {
       }
swish  {
 }
wiped out he said he had hid under the dead horse for a long time peeping  {
              }
out furtively  {
 }
across the common the cardigan men had tried a rush in skirmishing  {
          }
order at the pit simply to be swept out of existence then the monster had risen  {
              }
to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely  {
       }
to and fro across the common among the few fugitives  {
        }
with its headlike  {
 }
hood turning about exactly  {
  }
like the head of a cowled  {
    }
human being a kind of arm carried a complicated  {
	complicate :: 17
       }
metallic case about which green flashes scintillated  {
     }
and out of the funnel  {
   }
of this there smoked the heat ray in a few minutes there was so far as the soldier could see not a living thing left upon the common and every bush and tree upon it that was not already a blackened skeleton  {
                                        }
was burning the hussars had been on the road beyond the curvature  {
          }
of the ground and he saw nothing of them he heard the martians rattle for a time and then become still the giant saved woking station and its cluster  {
                           }
of houses until the last then in a moment the heat ray was brought to bear and the town became a heap of fiery ruins then the thing shut off the heat ray and turning its back upon the artilleryman  {
                                      }
began to waddle  {
 }
away towards the smouldering pine woods that sheltered  {
      }
the second cylinder as it did so a second glittering titan  {
         }
built  {
 }
itself up out of the pit the second monster followed the first and at that the artilleryman began to crawl very cautiously  {
                    }
across the hot heather ash towards horsell he managed  {
       }
to get alive into the ditch by the side of the road and so escaped to woking there his story became ejaculatory  {
                    }
the place was impassable  {
  }
it seems there were a few people alive there frantic for the most part and many burned  {
               }
and scalded  {
 }
he was turned aside by the fire and hid among some almost scorching  {
           }
heaps of broken wall as one of the martian giants  {
        }
returned he saw this one pursue  {
    }
a man catch  {
 }
him up in one of its steely  {
     }
tentacles and knock  {
 }
his head against the trunk  {
   }
of a pine tree at last after nightfall  {
      }
the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway embankment  {
           }
since then he had been skulking  {
    }
along towards maybury in the hope of getting out of danger londonward people were hiding  {
             }
in trenches and cellars  {
  }
and many of the survivors  {
   }
had made off towards woking village and send he had been consumed  {
          }
with thirst until he found one of the water mains  {
        }
near the railway arch smashed and the water bubbling  {
       }
out like a spring  {
  }
upon the road that was the story i got from him bit by bit he grew calmer  {
               }
telling me and trying to make me see the things he had seen he had eaten  {
              }
no food since midday he told me early in his narrative  {
         }
and i found some mutton  {
   }
and bread  {
 }
in the pantry  {
 }
and brought it into the room we lit no lamp for fear of attracting  {
            }
the martians and ever and again our hands would touch upon bread or meat as he talked things about us came darkly out of the darkness and the trampled bushes and broken rose trees outside the window grew distinct it would seem that a number of men or animals had rushed across the lawn i began to see his face blackened and haggard as no doubt mine was also when we had finished  {
                                                                       }
eating we went softly upstairs to my study and i looked again out of the open window in one night the valley had become a valley of ashes  {
                          }
the fires  {
 }
had dwindled  {
 }
now where flames had been there were now streamers of smoke but the countless ruins of shattered  {
               }
and gutted  {
 }
houses and blasted  {
 }
and blackened trees that the night had hidden stood out now gaunt  {
          }
and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn yet here and there some object had had the luck to escape a white railway signal here the end of a greenhouse  {
                            }
there white and fresh amid the wreckage  {
     }
never before in the history  {
   }
of warfare had destruction been so indiscriminate  {
     }
and so universal  {
 }
and shining with the growing light of the east three of the metallic giants stood about the pit their cowls  {
                  }
rotating as though they were surveying  {
    }
the desolation  {
 }
they had made it seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged and ever and again puffs of vivid green vapour  {
                    }
streamed  {
 }
up and out of it towards the brightening  {

      }
dawn streamed up whirled broke and vanished beyond were the pillars  {
         }
of fire about chobham they became pillars of bloodshot  {
       }
smoke at the first touch of day chapter twelve what i saw of the destruction of weybridge and shepperton  {
                 }
as the dawn grew brighter  {
   }
we withdrew  {
 }
from the window from which we had watched the martians and went very quietly downstairs  {
             }
the artilleryman agreed  {
 }
with me that the house was no place to stay in he proposed  {
           }
he said to make his way londonward and thence  {
       }
rejoin his battery  {
 }
no of the horse artillery my plan was to return at once to leatherhead and so greatly had the strength of the martians impressed  {
                      }
me that i had determined  {
   }
to take my wife to newhaven  {
	newval :: 8
    }
and go with her out of the country forthwith for i already perceived clearly that the country about london must inevitably be the scene  {
                      }
of a disastrous  {
 }
struggle before such creatures as these could be destroyed between us and leatherhead however lay the third cylinder with its guarding  {
                   }
giants had i been alone i think i should have taken my chance and struck across country but the artilleryman dissuaded  {
                   }
me it s no kindness  {
   }
to the right sort of wife he said to make her a widow  {
           }
and in the end i agreed to go with him under cover of the woods northward  {
              }
as far as street cobham before i parted with him thence i would make a big detour  {
               }
by epsom  {
 }
to reach leatherhead i should have started at once but my companion had been in active service  {
               }
and he knew better than that he made me ransack  {
        }
the house for a flask  {
   }
which he filled  {
 }
with whiskey and we lined  {
   }
every available  {
 }
pocket  {
 }
with packets  {
 }
of biscuits  {
 }
and slices  {
 }
of meat then we crept out of the house and ran as quickly  {
           }
as we could down the ill made road by which i had come overnight  {
            }
the houses seemed deserted in the road lay a group of three charred bodies close together struck dead by the heat ray and here and there were things that people had dropped a clock a slipper  {
                                  }
a silver spoon  {
 }
and the like poor valuables at the corner turning up towards the post office a little cart filled with boxes  {
                  }
and furniture and horseless  {
  }
heeled over on a broken wheel a cash  {
      }
box had been hastily smashed open and thrown  {
      }
under the debris  {
 }
except the lodge  {
 }
at the orphanage which was still on fire none of the houses had suffered  {
            }
very greatly here the heat ray had shaved  {
      }
the chimney tops and passed yet save ourselves  {
      }
there did not seem to be a living soul on maybury hill the majority of the inhabitants had escaped i suppose by way of the old woking road the road i had taken when i drove to leatherhead or they had hidden we went down the lane by the body of the man in black sodden  {
                                                      }
now from the overnight hail and broke into the woods at the foot of the hill we pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a soul the woods across the line were but the scarred  {
                                  }
and blackened ruins of woods for the most part the trees had fallen but a certain proportion  {
               }
still stood dismal  {
 }
grey stems  {
 }
with dark brown foliage instead of green on our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees it had failed to secure its footing  {
                          }
in one place the woodmen  {
   }
had been at work on saturday trees felled  {
      }
and freshly  {
 }
trimmed  {
 }
lay in a clearing with heaps of sawdust  {
      }
by the sawing  {
 }
machine and its engine hard by was a temporary  {
       }
hut deserted there was not a breath of wind this morning and everything was strangely still even the birds were hushed  {
                   }
and as we hurried along i and the artilleryman talked in whispers  {
          }
and looked now and again over our shoulders  {
      }
once or twice  {
 }
we stopped to listen after a time we drew near the road and as we did so we heard the clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry  {
                             }
soldiers riding  {
 }
slowly towards woking we hailed  {
   }
them and they halted  {
  }
while we hurried towards them it was a lieutenant  {
       }
and a couple of privates  {
   }
of the th hussars with a stand like a theodolite  {
        }
which the artilleryman told me was a heliograph  {
      }
you are the first men i ve seen coming this way this morning said the lieutenant what s brewing  {
                 }
his voice and face were eager the men behind him stared curiously the artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and saluted  {
                     }
gun destroyed last night sir  {
   }
have been hiding trying to rejoin battery sir you ll come in sight of the martians i expect about half a mile along this road what the dickens  {
                          }

         }
with a mighty  {
 }
great head in a hood sir get out said the lieutenant what confounded nonsense  {
            }
you ll see sir they carry a kind of box sir that shoots  {
           }
fire and strikes  {
 }
you dead what d ye mean a gun no sir and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the heat ray halfway  {
                    }
through the lieutenant interrupted  {
  }
him and looked up at me i was still standing on the bank by the side of the road it s perfectly true  {
                     }
i said well said the lieutenant i suppose it s my business to see it too look here to the artilleryman we re detailed  {
                      }
here clearing people out of their houses you d better go along and report yourself to brigadier  {
               }
general marvin  {
 }
and tell him all you know he s at weybridge know the way i do i said and he turned his horse southward  {
                     }
again half a mile you say said he at most i answered and pointed over the treetops southward he thanked  {
                  }
me and rode  {
 }
on and we saw them no more farther along we came upon a group of three women and two children in the road busy clearing out a labourer  {
                          }
s cottage  {
 }
they had got hold  {
  }
of a little hand truck and were piling  {
      }
it up with unclean  {
  }
looking bundles  {
 }
and shabby  {
 }
furniture they were all too assiduously  {
    }
engaged  {
 }
to talk to us as we passed by byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees and found the country calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight we were far beyond the range of the heat ray there and had it not been for the silent desertion  {
                                             }
of some of the houses the stirring movement of packing  {
        }
in others and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridge over the railway and staring down the line towards woking the day would have seemed very like any other sunday  {
                             }
several farm  {
 }
waggons  {
 }
and carts  {
 }
were moving creakily  {
 }
along the road to addlestone and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw across a stretch of flat meadow six twelve pounders  {
                      }
standing neatly  {
 }
at equal distances pointing towards woking the gunners stood by the guns waiting and the ammunition waggons were at a business like distance the men stood almost as if under inspection  {
                             }
that s good said i they will get one fair shot at any rate the artilleryman hesitated  {
               }
at the gate i shall go on he said farther on towards weybridge just over the bridge there were a number of men in white fatigue  {
                        }
jackets throwing up a long rampart  {
    }
and more guns behind it s bows  {
     }
and arrows  {
 }
against the lightning anyhow  {
  }
said the artilleryman they aven  {
	avens :: 7
   }
t seen that fire beam yet the officers who were not actively  {
          }
engaged stood and stared over the treetops southwestward  {
	southward :: 15
      }
and the men digging  {
  }
would stop every now and again to stare in the same direction byfleet was in a tumult people packing and a score  {
                    }
of hussars some of them dismounted some on horseback  {
       }
were hunting  {
 }
them about three or four black government  {
     }
waggons with crosses in white circles  {
    }
and an old omnibus  {
  }
among other vehicles were being loaded  {
    }
in the village street there were scores  {
     }
of people most of them sufficiently sabbatical  {
     }
to have assumed  {
 }
their best clothes the soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their position we saw one shrivelled  {
                     }
old fellow with a huge box and a score or more of flower pots  {
            }
containing orchids  {
 }
angrily  {
 }
expostulating  {
 }
with the corporal  {
 }
who would leave them behind i stopped and gripped his arm do you know what s over there i said pointing at the pine tops that hid the martians eh said he turning i was explainin  {

these is vallyble  {
 }
death i shouted death is coming death and leaving him to digest  {
          }
that if he could i hurried on after the artillery man at the corner i looked back the soldier had left him and he was still standing by his box with the pots of orchids on the lid of it and staring vaguely over the trees no one in weybridge could tell us where the headquarters  {
                                                      }
were established  {
 }
the whole place was in such confusion as i had never seen in any town before carts carriages everywhere the most astonishing  {

and horseflesh  {
 }
the respectable inhabitants of the place men in golf and boating  {
         }
costumes  {
 }
wives  {
 }
prettily  {
 }
dressed were packing river  {
  }
side loafers energetically  {
 }
helping  {
 }
children excited and for the most part highly  {
      }
delighted  {
 }
at this astonishing variation  {
  }
of their sunday experiences  {
	experience :: 13
  }
in the midst  {
 }
of it all the worthy  {
   }
vicar  {
 }
was very pluckily  {
 }
holding  {
 }
an early celebration  {
	calibration :: 18
 }
and his bell was jangling  {
   }
out above the excitement i and the artilleryman seated  {
       }
on the step of the drinking fountain  {
     }
made a very passable  {
  }
meal  {
 }
upon what we had brought with us patrols  {
      }
of soldiers here no longer hussars but grenadiers  {
      }
in white were warning people to move now or to take refuge  {
          }
in their cellars as soon as the firing began we saw as we crossed  {
            }
the railway bridge that a growing crowd of people had assembled  {
         }
in and about the railway station and the swarming  {
       }
platform  {
 }
was piled  {
 }
with boxes and packages  {
  }
the ordinary traffic  {
 }
had been stopped i believe in order to allow of the passage of troops and guns to chertsey and i have heard since that a savage  {
                        }
struggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at a later hour we remained at weybridge until midday and at that hour we found ourselves at the place near shepperton lock where the wey and thames  {
	                                 themes :: 10
	                                 shames :: 10
                                      }
join part of the time we spent  {
     }
helping two old women to pack a little cart the wey has a treble  {
            }
mouth and at this point boats  {
    }
are to be hired  {
  }
and there was a ferry  {
   }
across the river on the shepperton side was an inn with a lawn and beyond that the tower of shepperton church it has been replaced  {
                       }
by a spire rose above the trees here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives as yet the flight had not grown  {
                      }
to a panic but there were already far more people than all the boats going to and fro could enable  {
                  }
to cross people came panting along under heavy burdens  {
       }
one husband  {
 }
and wife were even carrying a small outhouse  {
      }
door between them with some of their household  {
      }
goods  {
 }
piled thereon  {
 }
one man told us he meant to try to get away from shepperton station there was a lot of shouting and one man was even jesting  {
                        }
the idea people seemed to have here was that the martians were simply formidable  {
            }
human beings who might attack  {
   }
and sack  {
 }
the town to be certainly destroyed in the end every now and then people would glance nervously  {
               }
across the wey at the meadows towards chertsey but everything over there was still across the thames except just where the boats landed  {
                     }
everything was quiet in vivid contrast with the surrey side the people who landed there from the boats went tramping  {
                  }
off down the lane the big ferryboat  {
     }
had just made a journey  {
   }
three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of the inn staring and jesting at the fugitives without offering  {
                 }
to help the inn was closed as it was now within prohibited  {
          }
hours what s that cried a boatman  {
     }
and shut up you fool said a man near me to a yelping  {
           }
dog then the sound came again this time from the direction of chertsey a muffled thud the sound of a gun the fighting was beginning almost immediately unseen batteries  {
                           }
across the river to our right unseen because of the trees took up the chorus  {
             }
firing heavily one after the other a woman screamed  {
       }
everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle near us and yet invisible to us nothing was to be seen save flat meadows cows  {
                       }
feeding unconcernedly  {
 }
for the most part and silvery pollard  {
     }
willows  {
 }
motionless in the warm sunlight the sojers  {
	 sorer :: 8
     }
ll stop em said a woman beside me doubtfully  {
       }
a haziness  {
 }
rose over the treetops then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river a puff of smoke that jerked  {
                     }
up into the air and hung  {
    }
and forthwith the ground heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air smashing two or three windows in the houses near and leaving us astonished here they are shouted a man in a blue jersey  {
                                   }
yonder d yer see them yonder quickly one after the other one two three four of the armoured  {
                }
martians appeared far away over the little trees across the flat meadows that stretched towards chertsey and striding hurriedly  {
                 }
towards the river little cowled figures they seemed at first going with a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds then advancing obliquely  {
                      }
towards us came a fifth  {
   }
their armoured bodies glittered  {
  }
in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the guns growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer one on the extreme left the remotest  {
                       }
that is flourished  {
 }
a huge case high in the air and the ghostly  {
        }
terrible heat ray i had already seen on friday night smote towards chertsey and struck the town at sight of these strange swift and terrible creatures the crowd near the water s edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror struck there was no screaming or shouting but a silence  {
                                                  }
then a hoarse  {
 }
murmur and a movement of feet a splashing  {
      }
from the water a man too frightened  {
     }
to drop the portmanteau  {
	portman :: 14
  }
he carried on his shoulder swung round and sent me staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden a woman thrust at me with her hand and rushed past me i turned with the rush of the people but i was not too terrified  {
                                            }
for thought the terrible heat ray was in my mind to get under water that was it get under water i shouted unheeded  {
                     }
i faced  {
 }
about again and rushed towards the approaching martian rushed right down the gravelly  {
           }
beach  {
 }
and headlong into the water others did the same a boatload  {
	   bottled :: 8
	    boatel :: 8
	    boated :: 8
	      boat :: 8
         }
of people putting back came leaping out as i rushed past the stones under my feet were muddy and slippery  {
                  }
and the river was so low that i ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waist  {
            }
deep then as the martian towered  {
    }
overhead scarcely a couple of hundred yards away i flung myself forward under the surface the splashes  {
               }
of the people in the boats leaping into the river sounded like thunderclaps in my ears  {
              }
people were landing  {
 }
hastily on both sides of the river but the martian machine took no more notice for the moment of the people running this way and that than a man would of the confusion of ants  {
                                 }
in a nest against which his foot has kicked  {
       }
when half suffocated  {
 }
i raised my head above water the martian s hood pointed at the batteries that were still firing across the river and as it advanced  {
                       }
it swung loose what must have been the generator  {
       }
of the heat ray in another moment it was on the bank and in a stride  {
              }
wading  {
 }
halfway across the knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank and in another moment it had raised itself to its full height again close to the village of shepperton forthwith the six guns which unknown to anyone on the right bank had been hidden behind the outskirts of that village fired simultaneously  {
                                                     }
the sudden near concussion the last close upon the first made my heart jump the monster was already raising  {
                 }
the case generating  {
 }
the heat ray as the first shell burst six yards above the hood i gave a cry of astonishment i saw and thought nothing of the other four martian monsters my attention was riveted  {
                                }
upon the nearer incident  {
  }
simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the body as the hood twisted  {
             }
round in time to receive but not in time to dodge  {
         }
the fourth  {
 }
shell the shell burst clean  {
   }
in the face of the thing the hood bulged flashed was whirled off in a dozen  {
              }
tattered  {
 }
fragments of red flesh  {
  }
and glittering metal hit shouted i with something between a scream and a cheer  {
            }
i heard answering  {
 }
shouts from the people in the water about me i could have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation  {
                   }

like a drunken giant but it did not fall over it recovered  {

its balance  {

by a miracle  {
 }
and no longer heeding  {
  }
its steps  {
 }
and with the camera  {

that fired the heat ray now rigidly  {
     }
upheld  {
 }
it reeled swiftly upon shepperton the living intelligence the martian within the hood was slain and splashed to the four winds  {
                   }
of heaven and the thing was now but a mere intricate  {
         }
device  {
 }
of metal whirling to destruction it drove along in a straight line incapable  {
           }
of guidance  {
 }
it struck the tower of shepperton church smashing it down as the impact of a battering  {

ram might have done swerved  {

aside blundered on and collapsed  {
   }
with tremendous  {

force into the river out of my sight a violent explosion shook the air and a spout  {
               }
of water steam mud and shattered metal shot far up into the sky as the camera of the heat ray hit the water the latter had immediately flashed into steam in another moment a huge wave  {
                                  }
like a muddy tidal  {
  }
bore  {
 }
but almost scaldingly  {
	scaldings :: 15
	scalding :: 16
 }
hot came sweeping round the bend  {
    }
upstream  {
 }
i saw people struggling shorewards  {
   }
and heard their screaming and shouting faintly above the seething  {
        }
and roar  {
 }
of the martian s collapse for a moment i heeded  {
        }
nothing of the heat forgot the patent  {
     }
need of self preservation  {
  }
i splashed through the tumultuous water pushing aside a man in black to do so until i could see round the bend half a dozen  {
                       }
deserted boats pitched aimlessly  {
  }
upon the confusion of the waves  {
    }
the fallen martian came into sight downstream  {
     }
lying across the river and for the most part submerged  {
        }
thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage and through the tumultuously  {
	  tumultuous :: 10
           }
whirling wisps i could see intermittently  {

    }
and vaguely the gigantic limbs churning  {
    }
the water and flinging  {
  }
a splash and spray  {
  }
of mud and froth  {
  }
into the air the tentacles swayed and struck like living arms and save for the helpless purposelessness  {
	       purposely :: 12
	         purpose :: 11
               }
of these movements it was as if some wounded  {
       }
thing were struggling for its life amid the waves enormous quantities  {
         }
of a ruddy brown fluid  {
   }
were spurting  {
 }
up in noisy jets  {
  }
out of the machine my attention was diverted  {
      }
from this death flurry  {
  }
by a furious  {
 }
yelling  {
 }
like that of the thing called a siren  {
      }
in our manufacturing  {
 }
towns  {
 }
a man knee deep near the towing  {
     }
path  {
 }
shouted inaudibly  {
 }
to me and pointed looking back i saw the other martians advancing with gigantic strides  {
             }
down the riverbank  {
 }
from the direction of chertsey the shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly  {
	 unavailing :: 11
	    unavail :: 11
          }
at that i ducked  {
  }
at once under water and holding my breath until movement was an agony  {
           }
blundered painfully ahead under the surface as long as i could the water was in a tumult about me and rapidly growing hotter  {
                     }
when for a moment i raised my head to take breath and throw the hair and water from my eyes the steam was rising in a whirling white fog  {
                           }
that at first hid the martians altogether the noise was deafening then i saw them dimly colossal figures of grey magnified  {
                   }
by the mist they had passed by me and two were stooping over the frothing  {
             }
tumultuous ruins of their comrade  {
   }
the third and fourth stood beside him in the water one perhaps two hundred yards from me the other towards laleham  {
	               almeh :: 7
	                lame :: 7
                   }
the generators  {
 }
of the heat rays  {
  }
waved  {
 }
high and the hissing beams  {
   }
smote down this way and that the air was full of sound a deafening and confusing conflict of noises  {
                 }
the clangorous  {
 }
din of the martians the crash of falling houses the thud of trees fences  {
            }
sheds  {
 }
flashing into flame and the crackling and roaring  {
      }
of fire dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with the steam from the river and as the heat ray went to and fro over weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames the nearer houses still stood intact  {
                                                    }
awaiting  {
 }
their fate shadowy  {
 }
faint and pallid in the steam with the fire behind them going to and fro for a moment perhaps i stood there breast  {
                     }
high in the almost boiling  {
   }
water dumbfounded at my position hopeless  {
    }
of escape through the reek  {
   }
i could see the people who had been with me in the river scrambling  {
            }
out of the water through the reeds like little frogs  {
        }
hurrying through grass  {
 }
from the advance of a man or running to and fro in utter dismay  {
            }
on the towing path then suddenly the white flashes of the heat ray came leaping towards me the houses caved  {
                  }
in as they dissolved  {
  }
at its touch and darted  {
   }
out flames the trees changed to fire with a roar the ray flickered  {
           }
up and down the towing path licking  {
     }
off the people who ran this way and that and came down to the water s edge not fifty yards from where i stood it swept across the river to shepperton and the water in its track  {
                                   }
rose in a boiling weal  {
   }
crested  {
 }
with steam i turned shoreward in another moment the huge wave well nigh at the boiling point had rushed upon me i screamed aloud  {
                      }
and scalded half blinded agonised  {
   }
i staggered through the leaping hissing water towards the shore had my foot stumbled it would have been the end i fell helplessly  {
                     }
in full sight of the martians upon the broad bare gravelly spit that runs down to mark the angle  {
                 }
of the wey and thames i expected nothing but death i have a dim memory of the foot of a martian coming down within a score of yards of my head driving straight into the loose gravel whirling it this way and that and lifting  {
                                           }
again of a long suspense and then of the four carrying the debris of their comrade between them now clear and then presently faint through a veil of smoke receding  {
                            }
interminably  {
 }
as it seemed to me across a vast space of river and meadow and then very slowly i realised that by a miracle i had escaped chapter thirteen  {
                          }
how i fell in with the curate  {
     }
after getting this sudden lesson  {
   }
in the power of terrestrial weapons  {
    }
the martians retreated  {
 }
to their original  {
 }
position upon horsell common and in their haste  {
      }
and encumbered  {
 }
with the debris of their smashed companion they no doubt overlooked many such a stray  {
             }
and negligible  {
 }
victim  {
 }
as myself had they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith there was nothing at that time between them and london but batteries of twelve pounder guns and they would certainly have reached the capital  {
                                 }
in advance of the tidings of their approach as sudden dreadful and destructive  {
           }
their advent would have been as the earthquake  {
      }
that destroyed lisbon  {
 }
a century ago but they were in no hurry cylinder followed cylinder on its interplanetary  {

that had been but a day ago pine spinneys  {

crawled the devoted  {

scouts  {
 }
with the heliographs  {

 }
that were presently to warn the gunners of the martian approach but the martians now understood our command of artillery and the danger of human proximity  {
                        }
and not a man ventured  {
   }
within a mile of either cylinder save at the price  {
        }
of his life it would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the afternoon in going to and fro transferring  {
                    }
everything from the second and third cylinders the second in addlestone golf links and the third at pyrford to their original pit on horsell common over that above the blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and wide  {
                                     }
stood one as sentinel while the rest abandoned  {
      }
their vast fighting machines and descended into the pit they were hard at work there far into the night and the towering  {
                    }
pillar of dense green smoke that rose therefrom  {
      }
could be seen from the hills about merrow  {
      }
and even it is said from banstead  {
	bedstead :: 11
     }
and epsom downs and while the martians behind me were thus preparing  {
          }
for their next sally  {
  }
and in front of me humanity  {
    }
gathered for the battle i made my way with infinite pains  {
         }
and labour from the fire and smoke of burning weybridge towards london i saw an abandoned boat very small and remote drifting down stream and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes i went after it gained  {
                                    }
it and so escaped out of that destruction there were no oars  {
          }
in the boat but i contrived  {
    }
to paddle  {
 }
as well as my parboiled  {
   }
hands would allow down the river towards halliford  {
      }
and walton  {
	wanton :: 10
	wantonly :: 10
 }
going very tediously  {
 }
and continually looking behind me as you may well understand i followed the river because i considered  {
               }
that the water gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return the hot water from the martian s overthrow  {
                    }
drifted  {
 }
downstream with me so that for the best part of a mile i could see little of either bank once however i made out a string  {
                        }
of black figures hurrying across the meadows from the direction of weybridge halliford it seemed was deserted and several of the houses facing  {
                     }
the river were on fire it was strange to see the place quite tranquil quite desolate under the hot blue sky with the smoke and little threads of flame going straight up into the heat of the afternoon never before had i seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive  {
                                                 }
crowd a little farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing and a line of fire inland  {
                   }
was marching  {
 }
steadily across a late field of hay for a long time i drifted so painful and weary was i after the violence i had been through and so intense the heat upon the water then my fears got the better of me again and i resumed  {
                                            }
my paddling  {
 }
the sun scorched  {
 }
my bare back at last as the bridge at walton was coming into sight round the bend my fever and faintness  {
                   }
overcame  {
 }
my fears and i landed on the middlesex bank and lay down deadly sick  {
            }
amid the long grass i suppose the time was then about four or five o clock i got up presently walked perhaps half a mile without meeting a soul and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge i seem to remember talking wanderingly  {
                                            }
to myself during that last spurt i was also very thirsty and bitterly  {
           }
regretful  {
 }
i had drunk no more water it is a curious thing that i felt angry with my wife i cannot account for it but my impotent  {
                        }
desire  {
 }
to reach leatherhead worried  {
  }
me excessively  {
	exclusively :: 13
 }
i do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate so that probably i dozed  {
             }
i became aware  {
 }
of him as a seated figure in soot  {
      }
smudged  {
 }
shirt sleeves  {
 }
and with his upturned  {
  }
clean shaven  {
 }
face staring at a faint flickering that danced over the sky the sky was what is called a mackerel  {
                 }
sky rows  {
 }
and rows of faint down plumes  {
    }
of cloud just tinted  {
  }
with the midsummer  {
 }
sunset i sat up and at the rustle  {
      }
of my motion he looked at me quickly have you any water i asked abruptly he shook his head you have been asking  {
                     }
for water for the last hour he said for a moment we were silent taking stock  {
              }
of each other i dare say he found me a strange enough figure naked  {
            }
save for my water soaked trousers and socks  {
      }
scalded and my face and shoulders blackened by the smoke his face was a fair weakness  {
              }
his chin retreated and his hair lay in crisp  {
       }
almost flaxen  {
 }
curls  {
 }
on his low forehead  {
  }
his eyes were rather large pale blue and blankly  {
       }
staring he spoke abruptly looking vacantly  {
    }
away from me what does it mean he said what do these things mean i stared at him and made no answer he extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining  {

tone  {
 }
why are these things permitted what sins  {
     }
have we done the morning service was over i was walking through the roads  {
            }
to clear my brain for the afternoon and then fire earthquake death as if it were sodom  {

               }
and gomorrah  {
 }
all our work undone  {
  }
all the work what are these martians what are we i answered clearing my throat  {
             }
he gripped his knees and turned to look at me again for half a minute perhaps he stared silently i was walking through the roads to clear my brain he said and suddenly fire earthquake death he relapsed  {
                                    }
into silence with his chin now sunken  {
     }
almost to his knees presently he began waving his hand all the work all the sunday schools  {
               }
what have we done what has weybridge done everything gone everything destroyed the church we rebuilt  {
              }
it only three years ago gone swept out of existence why another pause  {
           }
and he broke out again like one demented  {
      }
the smoke of her burning goeth  {
    }
up for ever and ever he shouted his eyes flamed  {

and he pointed a lean finger in the direction of weybridge by this time i was beginning to take his measure the tremendous tragedy in which he had been involved  {
                            }
it was evident he was a fugitive from weybridge had driven him to the very verge of his reason are we far from sunbury  {
	               sunberry :: 9
                      }
i said in a matter of fact tone what are we to do he asked are these creatures everywhere has the earth been given  {
                      }
over to them are we far from sunbury only this morning i officiated  {
           }
at early celebration things have changed i said quietly you must keep your head there is still hope hope yes  {
                  }
plentiful  {
 }
hope for all this destruction i began to explain my view of our position he listened at first but as i went on the interest dawning  {
                        }
in his eyes gave place to their former  {
      }
stare and his regard wandered  {
   }
from me this must be the beginning of the end he said interrupting  {

              }
upon the throne  {
 }
i began to understand the position i ceased my laboured  {
        }
reasoning struggled to my feet and standing over him laid my hand on his shoulder be a man said i you are scared out of your wits what good is religion  {
                             }
if it collapses  {
 }
under calamity think of what earthquakes  {

    }
and floods  {
 }
wars and volcanoes have done before to men did you think god had exempted  {
            }
weybridge he is not an insurance agent  {
     }
for a time he sat in blank silence but how can we escape he asked suddenly they are invulnerable  {
                 }
they are pitiless neither the one nor perhaps the other i answered and the mightier  {
             }
they are the more sane  {
   }
and wary  {
 }
should we be one of them was killed yonder not three hours ago killed he said staring about him how can god s ministers  {
                      }
be killed i saw it happen i proceeded  {
      }
to tell him we have chanced  {
    }
to come in for the thick of it said i and that is all what is that flicker in the sky he asked abruptly i told him it was the heliograph signalling that it was the sign of human help and effort in the sky we are in the midst of it i said quiet as it is that flicker in the sky tells  {
                                                              }
of the gathering storm yonder i take it are the martians and londonward where those hills rise about richmond and kingston and the trees give cover earthworks  {
                         }
are being thrown up and guns are being placed  {
       }
presently the martians will be coming this way again and even as i spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me by a gesture listen he said from beyond the low hills across the water came the dull resonance  {
                                      }
of distant guns and a remote weird  {
     }
crying then everything was still a cockchafer  {
     }
came droning over the hedge and past us high in the west the crescent moon  {
             }
hung faint and pale above the smoke of weybridge and shepperton and the hot still splendour  {
              }
of the sunset we had better follow this path i said northward chapter fourteen  {
            }
in london my younger  {
  }
brother  {
 }
was in london when the martians fell at woking he was a medical  {
           }
student working for an imminent examination  {
    }
and he heard nothing of the arrival until saturday morning the morning papers on saturday contained in addition to lengthy  {
                  }
special articles on the planet mars on life in the planets and so forth a brief  {
              }
and vaguely worded  {
 }
telegram all the more striking for its brevity  {
      }
the martians alarmed  {
 }
by the approach of a crowd had killed a number of people with a quick firing gun so the story ran the telegram concluded with the words  {
                         }
formidable as they seem to be the martians have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen and indeed seem incapable of doing so probably this is due to the relative  {
                               }
strength of the earth s gravitational energy on that last text  {
         }
their leader  {
 }
writer expanded  {
 }
very comfortingly  {
 }
of course all the students in the crammer  {
      }
s biology  {
 }
class  {
 }
to which my brother went that day were intensely interested  {
        }
but there were no signs of any unusual excitement in the streets the afternoon papers puffed  {
              }
scraps  {
 }
of news under big headlines they had nothing to tell beyond the movements of troops about the common and the burning of the pine woods between woking and weybridge until eight then the st james  {
                                 }
s gazette  {
 }
in an extra special edition announced  {
    }
the bare fact of the interruption  {
    }
of telegraphic  {
 }
communication this was thought to be due to the falling of burning pine trees across the line nothing more of the fighting was known that night the night of my drive to leatherhead and back my brother felt no anxiety  {
                                      }
about us as he knew from the description in the papers that the cylinder was a good two miles from my house he made up his mind to run down that night to me in order as he says  {
                                     }
to see the things before they were killed he dispatched  {
        }
a telegram which never reached me about four o clock and spent the evening at a music hall in london also on saturday night there was a thunderstorm and my brother reached waterloo in a cab on the platform from which the midnight train usually  {
                                           }
starts  {
 }
he learned after some waiting that an accident prevented trains from reaching  {
          }
woking that night the nature of the accident he could not ascertain  {
          }
indeed the railway authorities did not clearly know at that time there was very little excitement in the station as the officials  {
                    }
failing  {
 }
to realise that anything further than a breakdown  {
      }
between byfleet and woking junction had occurred were running the theatre  {
         }
trains which usually passed through woking round by virginia  {

the breakdown with the martians i have read in another account of these events that on sunday morning all london was electrified  {
	            electrify :: 12
                    }
by the news from woking as a matter of fact there was nothing to justify  {

 }
did not hear of the martians until the panic of monday  {
         }
morning those who did took some time to realise all that the hastily worded telegrams  {
             }
in the sunday papers conveyed  {
   }
the majority of people in london do not read sunday papers the habit of personal  {
             }
security  {
 }
moreover  {
 }
is so deeply  {
 }
fixed in the londoner s mind and startling  {
      }
intelligence so much a matter of course in the papers that they could read without any personal tremors  {
                }
about seven o clock last night the martians came out of the cylinder and moving about under an armour of metallic shields  {
                    }
have completely wrecked woking station with the adjacent houses and massacred  {
         }
an entire battalion  {
 }
of the cardigan regiment no details are known maxims have been absolutely useless  {
           }
against their armour the field guns have been disabled  {
       }
by them flying hussars have been galloping into chertsey the martians appear to be moving slowly towards chertsey or windsor  {
                  }
great anxiety prevails  {
 }
in west surrey and earthworks are being thrown up to check  {
         }
the advance londonward that was how the sunday sun put it and a clever  {
            }
and remarkably  {
 }
prompt  {
 }
handbook  {
 }
article in the referee  {
  }
compared the affair to a menagerie  {
    }
suddenly let loose in a village no one in london knew positively  {
          }
of the nature of the armoured martians and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be sluggish crawling creeping painfully such expressions  {
                       }
occurred in almost all the earlier reports  {
     }
none of the telegrams could have been written  {
      }
by an eyewitness  {
 }
of their advance the sunday papers printed  {
     }
separate  {
 }
editions as further news came to hand some even in default  {
         }
of it but there was practically nothing more to tell people until late in the afternoon when the authorities gave the press agencies  {
                     }
the news in their possession  {
   }
it was stated that the people of walton and weybridge and all the district were pouring along the roads londonward and that was all my brother went to church at the foundling  {
                              }
hospital  {
 }
in the morning still in ignorance of what had happened on the previous night there he heard allusions  {
                }
made to the invasion  {
  }
and a special prayer  {
  }
for peace coming out he bought  {
    }
a referee he became alarmed at the news in this and went again to waterloo station to find out if communication were restored  {
                     }
the omnibuses  {
 }
carriages cyclists and innumerable  {
  }
people walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely affected by the strange intelligence that the news venders  {
               }
were disseminating  {
 }
people were interested or if alarmed alarmed only on account of the local  {
           }
residents  {
 }
at the station he heard for the first time that the windsor and chertsey lines  {
             }
were now interrupted the porters  {
   }
told him that several remarkable telegrams had been received in the morning from byfleet and chertsey stations  {
               }
but that these had abruptly ceased my brother could get very little precise  {
           }
detail out of them there s fighting going on about weybridge was the extent  {
            }
of their information  {
 }
the train service was now very much disorganised  {
	disorganic :: 14
	disarrange :: 13
      }
quite a number of people who had been expecting  {
       }
friends  {
 }
from places on the south western network  {
     }
were standing about the station one grey headed  {
      }
old gentleman  {
 }
came and abused  {
 }
the south western company bitterly to my brother it wants  {
        }
showing up he said one or two trains came in from richmond putney  {
           }
and kingston containing people who had gone out for a day s boating and found the locks  {
               }
closed and a feeling of panic in the air a man in a blue and white blazer  {
               }
addressed my brother full of strange tidings there s hosts  {
        }
of people driving into kingston in traps  {
     }
and carts and things with boxes of valuables and all that he said they come from molesey  {
	           moles :: 10
	          molest :: 9
               }
and weybridge and walton and they say there s been guns heard at chertsey heavy firing and that mounted soldiers have told them to get off at once because the martians are coming we heard guns firing at hampton  {
                                     }

station but we thought it was thunder what the dickens does it all mean the martians can t get out of their pit can they my brother could not tell him afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to the clients  {

early hours but not a soul had anything more than vague hearsay  {
          }
to tell of everyone connected with the terminus  {
      }
seemed ill tempered  {
 }
about five o clock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely excited by the opening of the line of communication which is almost invariably  {
                       }
closed between the south eastern  {
   }
and the south western stations and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and carriages crammed  {
               }
with soldiers these were the guns that were brought up from woolwich  {
          }
and chatham  {

 }
to cover kingston there was an exchange of pleasantries  {
       }

       }
and so forth a little while after that a squad of police came into the station and began to clear the public off the platforms  {
                       }
and my brother went out into the street again the church bells  {
          }
were ringing for evensong  {
  }
and a squad of salvation  {
   }
army  {
 }
lassies  {
 }
came singing down waterloo road on the bridge a number of loafers were watching a curious brown scum  {
                }
that came drifting down the stream in patches the sun was just setting and the clock tower and the houses of parliament  {
                    }
rose against one of the most peaceful skies  {
      }
it is possible to imagine a sky of gold  {
       }
barred  {
 }
with long transverse stripes of reddish purple cloud there was talk of a floating  {
            }
body one of the men there a reservist  {
      }
he said he was told my brother he had seen the heliograph flickering in the west in wellington  {
	          welting :: 13
                }
street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs  {
       }
who had just been rushed out of fleet  {
      }
street with still wet newspapers  {
   }
and staring placards  {
 }
dreadful catastrophe  {
 }
they bawled one to the other down wellington street fighting at weybridge full description repulse  {
             }
of the martians london in danger he had to give threepence  {
         }
for a copy of that paper then it was and then only that he realised something of the full power and terror of these monsters he learned that they were not merely  {
                              }
a handful of small sluggish creatures but that they were minds swaying vast mechanical bodies and that they could move swiftly and smite  {
                     }
with such power that even the mightiest  {
     }
guns could not stand against them they were described as vast spiderlike  {
	     spider :: 12
          }
machines nearly a hundred feet high capable  {
     }
of the speed  {
 }
of an express train and able to shoot out a beam of intense heat masked batteries chiefly of field guns had been planted  {
                     }
in the country about horsell common and especially between the woking district and london five of the machines had been seen moving towards the thames and one by a happy chance had been destroyed in the other cases  {
                                    }
the shells had missed and the batteries had been at once annihilated  {
	 annihilate :: 11
          }
by the heat rays heavy losses  {
    }
of soldiers were mentioned  {
  }
but the tone of the dispatch was optimistic  {
      }
the martians had been repulsed  {
   }
they were not invulnerable they had retreated to their triangle  {
        }
of cylinders again in the circle about woking signallers  {
       }
with heliographs were pushing forward upon them from all sides guns were in rapid transit from windsor portsmouth aldershot woolwich even from the north among others long wire guns of ninety five tons  {
                               }
from woolwich altogether one hundred and sixteen  {
     }
were in position or being hastily placed chiefly covering  {

london never before in england had there been such a vast or rapid concentration  {

of military material any further cylinders that fell it was hoped  {

could be destroyed at once by high explosives  {

which were being rapidly manufactured  {

and distributed  {

no doubt ran the report the situation  {

was of the strangest and gravest description but the public was exhorted  {
          }
to avoid and discourage  {
  }
panic no doubt the martians were strange and terrible in the extreme but at the outside there could not be more than twenty of them against our millions the authorities had reason to suppose from the size  {
                                   }
of the cylinders that at the outside there could not be more than five in each cylinder fifteen  {

altogether and one at least was disposed  {

of perhaps more the public would be fairly  {

measures  {
 }
were being taken for the protection  {
    }
of the people in the threatened southwestern  {
	southern :: 13
	southerner :: 13
     }
suburbs  {
 }
and so with reiterated  {
  }
assurances  {
 }
of the safety of london and the ability  {
      }
of the authorities to cope with the difficulty this quasi  {
        }
proclamation  {
 }
closed this was printed in enormous type  {
     }
on paper so fresh that it was still wet and there had been no time to add a word of comment  {
                   }
it was curious my brother said to see how ruthlessly  {
        }
the usual contents  {
 }
of the paper had been hacked  {
    }
and taken out to give this place all down wellington street people could be seen fluttering  {
              }
out the pink sheets  {
  }
and reading  {
 }
and the strand  {
 }
was suddenly noisy with the voices of an army of hawkers  {
         }
following these pioneers  {
 }
men came scrambling off buses  {
   }
to secure copies  {
 }
certainly this news excited people intensely whatever their previous apathy  {
        }
the shutters of a map shop in the strand were being taken down my brother said and a man in his sunday raiment  {
                     }
lemon yellow gloves  {
 }
even was visible inside the window hastily fastening  {
      }
maps  {
 }
of surrey to the glass going on along the strand to trafalgar  {
	      graft :: 8
          }
square the paper in his hand my brother saw some of the fugitives from west surrey there was a man with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in a cart such as greengrocers  {
                                   }
use he was driving from the direction of westminster  {
	wintriness :: 11
	westernism :: 11
       }
bridge and close behind him came a hay waggon with five or six respectable looking people in it and some boxes and bundles the faces of these people were haggard and their entire appearance contrasted  {
                                 }
conspicuously  {
 }
with the sabbath  {
 }
best appearance of the people on the omnibuses people in fashionable  {
         }
clothing  {
 }
peeped  {
 }
at them out of cabs  {
   }
they stopped at the square as if undecided  {
      }
which way to take and finally turned eastward along the strand some way behind these came a man in workday  {
                  }
clothes riding one of those old fashioned  {
     }
tricycles  {
 }
with a small front wheel he was dirty and white in the face my brother turned down towards victoria  {
                 }
and met a number of such people he had a vague idea that he might see something of me he noticed an unusual number of police regulating  {
                         }
the traffic some of the refugees  {
    }
were exchanging  {
 }
news with the people on the omnibuses one was professing  {
        }
to have seen the martians boilers  {
    }
on stilts  {
 }
i tell you striding along like men most of them were excited and animated by their strange experience beyond victoria the public houses were doing a lively  {
                         }
trade  {
 }
with these arrivals at all the street corners  {
      }
groups of people were reading papers talking excitedly or staring at these unusual sunday visitors  {
             }
they seemed to increase as night drew on until at last the roads my brother said were like epsom high street on a derby  {
                      }
day my brother addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory  {
         }
answers  {
 }
from most none of them could tell him any news of woking except one man who assured  {
               }
him that woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous night i come from byfleet he said man on a bicycle came through the place in the early morning and ran from door to door warning us to come away then came soldiers we went out to look and there were clouds of smoke to the south nothing but smoke and not a soul coming that way then we heard the guns at chertsey and folks coming from weybridge so i ve locked up my house and come on at the time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the authorities were to blame  {
                                                                                                        }
for their incapacity  {
 }
to dispose of the invaders without all this inconvenience about eight o clock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audible all over the south of london my brother could not hear it for the traffic in the main thoroughfares  {
                                      }
but by striking through the quiet back streets to the river he was able to distinguish it quite plainly  {
                 }
he walked from westminster to his apartments  {
     }
near regent  {
 }
s park about two he was now very anxious on my account and disturbed at the evident magnitude  {
                }
of the trouble his mind was inclined to run even as mine had run on saturday on military details he thought of all those silent expectant guns of the suddenly nomadic  {
                             }
countryside  {
 }
he tried to imagine boilers on stilts a hundred feet high there were one or two cartloads  {
               }
of refugees passing  {
 }
along oxford  {
 }
street and several in the marylebone  {
    }
road but so slowly was the news spreading that regent street and portland  {
           }
place were full of their usual sunday night promenaders  {
       }
albeit they talked in groups and along the edge of regent s park there were as many silent couples  {
                 }
walking out together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there had been the night was warm and still and a little oppressive  {
                     }
the sound of guns continued  {
   }
intermittently and after midnight there seemed to be sheet lightning in the south he read and re read the paper fearing  {
                   }
the worst had happened to me he was restless and after supper prowled  {
           }
out again aimlessly he returned and tried in vain to divert his attention to his examination notes he went to bed a little after midnight and was awakened  {
                          }
from lurid dreams in the small hours of monday by the sound of door knockers  {
             }
feet running in the street distant drumming  {
     }
and a clamour of bells red reflections danced on the ceiling for a moment he lay astonished wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad then he jumped out of bed and ran to the window his room was an attic  {
                                         }
and as he thrust his head out up and down the street there were a dozen  {
              }
echoes  {
 }
to the noise of his window sash  {
     }
and heads in every kind of night disarray  {
      }
appeared enquiries  {
 }
were being shouted they are coming bawled a policeman hammering at the door the martians are coming and hurried to the next door the sound of drumming and trumpeting  {
                           }
came from the albany  {
  }
street barracks and every church within earshot  {
     }
was hard at work killing sleep with a vehement  {
       }
disorderly  {
 }
tocsin  {
 }
there was a noise of doors opening and window after window in the houses opposite flashed from darkness into yellow illumination  {
	          albuminate :: 11
	          illuminato :: 13
	          illuminati :: 12
	          illuminate :: 11
                   }
up the street came galloping a closed carriage bursting  {
       }
abruptly into noise at the corner rising to a clattering climax  {
         }
under the window and dying away slowly in the distance close on the rear of this came a couple of cabs the forerunners  {
	             forenoons :: 9

                     }
of a long procession  {
  }
of flying vehicles going for the most part to chalk  {
        }
farm station where the north western special trains were loading  {
        }
up instead of coming down the gradient  {
     }
into euston  {
 }
for a long time my brother stared out of the window in blank astonishment watching the policemen hammering at door after door and delivering  {
                      }
their incomprehensible  {
 }
message then the door behind him opened and the man who lodged  {
          }
across the landing came in dressed only in shirt trousers and slippers  {
          }
his braces  {
 }
loose about his waist his hair disordered from his pillow  {
        }
what the devil  {
 }
is it he asked a fire what a devil of a row they both craned  {
             }
their heads out of the window straining  {
     }
to hear what the policemen were shouting people were coming out of the side streets and standing in groups at the corners talking what the devil is it all about said my brother s fellow lodger  {
                                  }
my brother answered him vaguely and began to dress running with each garment to the window in order to miss nothing of the growing excitement and presently men selling unnaturally early newspapers came bawling  {
                                }
into the street london in danger of suffocation  {
      }
the kingston and richmond defences  {
   }
forced  {
 }
fearful  {
 }
massacres  {
 }
in the thames valley and all about him in the rooms  {
         }
below in the houses on each side and across the road and behind in the park terraces  {
               }
and in the hundred other streets of that part of marylebone and the westbourne  {
            }
park district and st pancras  {
   }
and westward  {
 }
and northward in kilburn  {
  }
and st john  {
 }
s wood and hampstead  {
	heapstead :: 13
  }
and eastward in shoreditch  {
  }
and highbury  {
 }
and haggerston  {
 }
and hoxton  {
 }
and indeed through all the vastness  {
    }
of london from ealing  {
  }
to east ham people were rubbing  {
    }
their eyes and opening windows to stare out and ask aimless questions dressing  {
           }
hastily as the first breath of the coming storm of fear blew through the streets it was the dawn of the great panic london which had gone to bed on sunday night oblivious  {
                               }
and inert was awakened in the small hours of monday morning to a vivid sense of danger unable from his window to learn what was happening my brother went down and out into the street just as the sky between the parapets  {
                                        }
of the houses grew pink with the early dawn the flying people on foot and in vehicles grew more numerous  {
                  }
every moment black smoke he heard people crying and again black smoke the contagion of such a unanimous  {
                }
fear was inevitable as my brother hesitated on the door step he saw another news vender approaching and got a paper forthwith the man was running away with the rest and selling his papers for a shilling  {
                                   }
each as he ran a grotesque mingling of profit  {
       }
and panic and from this paper my brother read that catastrophic  {
         }
dispatch of the commander  {
  }
in chief the martians are able to discharge  {
      }
enormous clouds of a black and poisonous  {
     }
vapour by means of rockets  {
   }
they have smothered  {
 }
our batteries destroyed richmond kingston and wimbledon and are advancing slowly towards london destroying everything on the way it is impossible to stop them there is no safety from the black smoke but in instant flight that was all but it was enough the whole population  {
                                            }
of the great six million city  {
    }
was stirring slipping  {
 }
running presently it would be pouring en masse northward black smoke the voices cried fire the bells of the neighbouring  {
                  }
church made a jangling tumult a cart carelessly  {
      }
driven smashed amid shrieks and curses  {
    }
against the water trough  {
  }
up the street sickly  {
  }
yellow lights went to and fro in the houses and some of the passing cabs flaunted  {
              }
unextinguished  {
 }
lamps and overhead the dawn was growing brighter clear and steady and calm he heard footsteps  {
              }
running to and fro in the rooms and up and down stairs  {
          }
behind him his landlady  {
  }
came to the door loosely  {
   }
wrapped  {
 }
in dressing gown  {
 }
and shawl  {
 }
her husband followed ejaculating  {
  }
as my brother began to realise the import  {
      }
of all these things he turned hastily to his own room put all his available money  {
              }
some ten pounds altogether into his pockets  {
     }
and went out again into the streets chapter fifteen what had happened in surrey it was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under the hedge in the flat meadows near halliford and while my brother was watching the fugitives stream over westminster bridge that the martians had resumed the offensive  {
                                                     }
so far as one can ascertain from the conflicting  {
       }
accounts  {
 }
that have been put forth the majority of them remained busied with preparations in the horsell pit until nine that night hurrying on some operation  {
                       }
that disengaged  {
 }
huge volumes  {
 }
of green smoke but three certainly came out about eight o clock and advancing slowly and cautiously made their way through byfleet and pyrford towards ripley and weybridge and so came in sight of the expectant batteries against the setting sun these martians did not advance in a body but in a line each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest fellow they communicated  {
                                                                }
with one another by means of sirenlike  {
	 siren :: 10
     }
howls  {
 }
running up and down the scale from one note to another it was this howling  {
             }
and firing of the guns at ripley and st george  {

s hill that we had heard at upper halliford the ripley gunners unseasoned  {
           }
artillery volunteers  {
 }
who ought never to have been placed in such a position fired one wild premature  {
             }
ineffectual  {
 }
volley  {
 }
and bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village while the martian without using his heat ray walked serenely  {
                  }
over their guns stepped gingerly among them passed in front of them and so came unexpectedly upon the guns in painshill  {
	               pains :: 10
	              palish :: 10

park which he destroyed the st george s hill men however were better led  {
            }
or of a better mettle  {
   }
hidden by a pine wood as they were they seem to have been quite unsuspected by the martian nearest to them they laid their guns as deliberately  {
                         }
as if they had been on parade and fired at about a thousand yards range the shells flashed all round him and he was seen to advance a few paces  {
                            }
stagger and go down everybody  {
   }
yelled  {
 }
together and the guns were reloaded  {
    }
in frantic haste the overthrown  {
   }
martian set up a prolonged  {
   }
ululation  {
 }
and immediately a second glittering giant answering him appeared over the trees to the south it would seem that a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells the whole of the second volley flew wide of the martian on the ground and simultaneously both his companions  {
                                                 }
brought their heat rays to bear on the battery the ammunition blew up the pine trees all about the guns flashed into fire and only one or two of the men who were already running over the crest of the hill escaped after this it would seem that the three took counsel  {
                                                  }
together and halted and the scouts who were watching them report that they remained absolutely stationary  {
              }
for the next half hour the martian who had been overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood a small brown figure oddly  {
                    }
suggestive  {
 }
from that distance of a speck of blight  {
      }
and apparently engaged in the repair  {
    }
of his support about nine he had finished for his cowl was then seen above the trees again it was a few minutes past nine that night when these three sentinels  {
                             }
were joined  {
 }
by four other martians each carrying a thick black tube  {
        }
a similar  {
 }
tube was handed  {
 }
to each of the three and the seven proceeded to distribute themselves at equal distances along a curved  {
                }
line between st george s hill weybridge and the village of send southwest of ripley a dozen  {
               }
rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they began to move and warned the waiting batteries about ditton  {
	              dinmont :: 8
                    }
and esher  {
	usher :: 6
 }
at the same time four of their fighting machines similarly  {
        }
armed  {
 }
with tubes  {
 }
crossed the river and two of them black against the western sky came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily  {
                      }
and painfully along the road that runs northward out of halliford they moved as it seemed to us upon a cloud for a milky  {
                      }
mist covered the fields  {
  }
and rose to a third of their height at this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat and began running but i knew it was no good running from a martian and i turned aside and crawled through dewy  {
                                      }
nettles  {
 }
and brambles  {
 }
into the broad ditch by the side of the road he looked back saw what i was doing and turned to join me the two halted the nearer to us standing and facing sunbury the remoter being a grey indistinctness  {

the occasional howling of the martians had ceased they took up their positions  {
           }
in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute silence it was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns never since the devising  {
                      }
of gunpowder  {
 }
was the beginning of a battle so still to us and to an observer about ripley it would have had precisely  {
                   }
the same effect the martians seemed in solitary  {
      }
possession of the darkling  {
  }
night lit only as it was by the slender  {
       }
moon the stars the afterglow of the daylight and the ruddy glare from st george s hill and the woods of painshill but facing that crescent everywhere at staines hounslow  {
                            }
ditton esher ockham behind hills and woods south of the river and across the flat grass meadows to the north of it wherever  {
                     }
a cluster of trees or village houses gave sufficient cover the guns were waiting the signal rockets burst and rained  {
                  }
their sparks through the night and vanished and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a tense  {
                 }
expectation the martians had but to advance into the line of fire and instantly those motionless black forms of men those guns glittering so darkly in the early night would explode into a thunderous  {
                                }
fury  {
 }
of battle no doubt the thought that was uppermost  {
       }
in a thousand of those vigilant  {
    }
minds even as it was uppermost in mine was the riddle  {
         }
how much they understood of us did they grasp  {
       }
that we in our millions were organized  {
     }
disciplined  {
	discipline :: 15
	disincline :: 12
 }
working together or did they interpret our spurts  {
      }
of fire the sudden stinging  {
   }
of our shells our steady investment  {
    }
of their encampment as we should the furious unanimity of onslaught  {
         }
in a disturbed hive  {
  }
of bees  {
 }
did they dream they might exterminate  {
    }
us at that time no one knew what food they needed  {
         }
a hundred such questions struggled together in my mind as i watched that vast sentinel shape and in the back of my mind was the sense of all the huge unknown and hidden forces  {
                                }
londonward had they prepared pitfalls  {
   }
were the powder  {
 }
mills  {
 }
at hounslow ready as a snare  {
    }
would the londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater moscow  {
           }
of their mighty province  {
  }
of houses then after an interminable  {
	interramal :: 13
	intermodal :: 13
    }
time as it seemed to us crouching and peering through the hedge came a sound like the distant concussion of a gun another nearer and then another and then the martian beside us raised his tube on high and discharged  {
                                      }
it gunwise  {
	sunwise :: 12
 }
with a heavy report that made the ground heave the one towards staines answered him there was no flash no smoke simply that loaded detonation i was so excited by these heavy minute guns following one another that i so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber up into the hedge and stare towards sunbury as i did so a second report followed and a big projectile hurtled  {
                                                                       }
overhead towards hounslow i expected at least to see smoke or fire or some such evidence of its work but all i saw was the deep blue sky above with one solitary star and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath and there had been no crash no answering explosion the silence was restored the minute lengthened  {
                                                        }
to three what has happened said the curate standing up beside me heaven knows said i a bat flickered by and vanished a distant tumult of shouting began and ceased i looked again at the martian and saw he was now moving eastward along the riverbank with a swift rolling motion every moment i expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring upon him but the evening calm was unbroken the figure of the martian grew smaller as he receded  {
                                                                               }
and presently the mist and the gathering night had swallowed him up by a common impulse we clambered higher towards sunbury was a dark appearance as though a conical  {
                           }
hill had suddenly come into being there hiding our view of the farther country and then remoter across the river over walton we saw another such summit  {
                         }
these hill like forms grew lower and broader  {
      }
even as we stared moved by a sudden thought i looked northward and there i perceived a third of these cloudy black kopjes  {
                     }
had risen everything had suddenly become very still far away to the southeast  {

           }
marking the quiet we heard the martians hooting  {
      }
to one another and then the air quivered again with the distant thud of their guns but the earthly artillery made no reply now at the time we could not understand these things but later i was to learn the meaning of these ominous  {
                                          }
kopjes that gathered in the twilight each of the martians standing in the great crescent i have described had discharged by means of the gunlike  {
                       }
tube he carried a huge canister  {
    }
over whatever hill copse cluster of houses or other possible cover for guns chanced to be in front of him some fired only one of these some two as in the case of the one we had seen the one at ripley is said to have discharged no fewer  {
                                               }
than five at that time these canisters  {
     }
smashed on striking the ground they did not explode and incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy inky  {
                }
vapour coiling  {
 }
and pouring upward  {
 }
in a huge and ebony  {
   }
cumulus  {
 }
cloud a gaseous  {
 }
hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country and the touch of that vapour the inhaling  {
                 }
of its pungent  {
 }
wisps was death to all that breathes  {
     }
it was heavy this vapour heavier  {
    }
than the densest  {
 }
smoke so that after the first tumultuous uprush  {
      }
and outflow  {
 }
of its impact it sank down through the air and poured  {
         }
over the ground in a manner  {
    }
rather liquid  {
 }
than gaseous abandoning  {
 }
the hills and streaming into the valleys  {
     }
and ditches and watercourses  {
  }
even as i have heard the carbonic  {
     }
acid  {
 }
gas that pours  {
 }
from volcanic clefts  {
 }
is wont  {
 }
to do and where it came upon water some chemical  {
        }
action occurred and the surface would be instantly covered with a powdery  {
          }
scum that sank slowly and made way for more the scum was absolutely insoluble  {
            }
and it is a strange thing seeing  {
     }
the instant effect of the gas that one could drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained  {
                  }
the vapour did not diffuse  {
   }
as a true gas would do it hung together in banks flowing  {
          }
sluggishly  {
 }
down the slope of the land and driving reluctantly  {
	reluctance :: 14
	reluctancy :: 16
	reluctant :: 15
       }
before the wind and very slowly it combined  {
      }
with the mist and moisture  {
   }
of the air and sank to the earth in the form of dust save that an unknown element  {
                }
giving a group of four lines in the blue of the spectrum  {
          }
is concerned  {
 }
we are still entirely ignorant  {
   }
of the nature of this substance  {
    }
once the tumultuous upheaval  {
  }
of its dispersion  {
 }
was over the black smoke clung  {
    }
so closely to the ground even before its precipitation  {
       }
that fifty feet up in the air on the roofs and upper stories of high houses and on great trees there was a chance of escaping its poison altogether as was proved even that night at street cobham and ditton the man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of the strangeness of its coiling flow and how he looked down from the church spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts  {
                                                                            }
out of its inky nothingness  {
	nothings :: 12
   }
for a day and a half he remained there weary starving  {
         }
and sun scorched the earth under the blue sky and against the prospect  {
           }
of the distant hills a velvet  {
    }
black expanse with red roofs green trees and later black veiled  {
         }
shrubs and gates barns  {
  }
outhouses  {
 }
and walls  {
 }
rising here and there into the sunlight but that was at street cobham where the black vapour was allowed to remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground as a rule the martians when it had served its purpose cleared the air of it again by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it this they did with the vapour banks near us as we saw in the starlight from the window of a deserted house at upper halliford whither  {
                                                                                    }
we had returned from there we could see the searchlights  {
        }
on richmond hill and kingston hill going to and fro and about eleven the windows rattled  {
              }
and we heard the sound of the huge siege  {
       }
guns that had been put in position there these continued intermittently for the space of a quarter of an hour sending chance shots at the invisible martians at hampton and ditton and then the pale beams of the electric light vanished and were replaced by a bright red glow then the fourth cylinder fell a brilliant  {
                                                      }
green meteor as i learned afterwards in bushey  {
      }
park before the guns on the richmond and kingston line of hills began there was a fitful  {
               }
cannonade  {
 }
far away in the southwest due i believe to guns being fired haphazard  {
           }
before the black vapour could overwhelm  {
    }
the gunners so setting about it as methodically  {
	methodical :: 20
      }
as men might smoke out a wasps  {
     }
nest the martians spread this strange stifling  {
     }
vapour over the londonward country the horns of the crescent slowly moved apart until at last they formed  {
                }
a line from hanwell  {
	hansel :: 9
  }
to coombe  {
 }
and malden  {
	madden :: 10
 }
all night through their destructive tubes advanced never once after the martian at st george s hill was brought down did they give the artillery the ghost of a chance against them wherever there was a possibility  {
                                   }
of guns being laid for them unseen a fresh canister of the black vapour was discharged and where the guns were openly  {
                    }
displayed  {
 }
the heat ray was brought to bear by midnight the blazing  {
         }
trees along the slopes of richmond park and the glare of kingston hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke blotting  {
                     }
out the whole valley of the thames and extending  {
       }
as far as the eye could reach and through this two martians slowly waded  {
            }
and turned their hissing steam jets this way and that they were sparing  {
           }
of the heat ray that night either because they had but a limited  {
           }
supply  {
 }
of material for its production  {
   }
or because they did not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe  {
              }
the opposition they had aroused in the latter aim they certainly succeeded sunday night was the end of the organised  {
                  }
opposition to their movements after that no body of men would stand against them so hopeless was the enterprise even the crews  {
                    }
of the torpedo  {
 }
boats and destroyers  {
 }
that had brought their quick firers  {
    }
up the thames refused  {
  }
to stop mutinied  {
 }
and went down again the only offensive operation men ventured upon after that night was the preparation of mines  {
                 }
and pitfalls and even in that their energies  {
      }
were frantic and spasmodic  {
  }
one has to imagine as well as one may the fate of those batteries towards esher waiting so tensely  {
                 }
in the twilight survivors there were none one may picture the orderly  {
          }
expectation the officers alert  {
  }
and watchful  {
 }
the gunners ready the ammunition piled to hand the limber gunners with their horses and waggons the groups of civilian  {
                  }
spectators standing as near as they were permitted the evening stillness the ambulances  {
           }
and hospital tents  {
 }
with the burned and wounded from weybridge then the dull resonance of the shots the martians fired and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and houses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields one may picture too the sudden shifting  {
                                      }
of the attention the swiftly spreading coils  {
     }
and bellyings  {
 }
of that blackness advancing headlong towering heavenward  {
     }
turning the twilight to a palpable  {
    }
darkness a strange and horrible  {
   }
antagonist of vapour striding upon its victims  {
     }
men and horses near it seen dimly running shrieking  {
       }
falling headlong shouts of dismay the guns suddenly abandoned men choking  {
         }
and writhing on the ground and the swift broadening  {
       }
out of the opaque  {
  }
cone  {
 }
of smoke and then night and extinction  {
     }
nothing but a silent mass of impenetrable  {
     }
vapour hiding its dead before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of richmond and the disintegrating  {

refused to return to london the pressure of the flight drove the people in an ever thickening  {
               }
multitude away from the stations and along the northward running roads by midday a martian had been seen at barnes and a cloud of slowly sinking  {
                        }
black vapour drove along the thames and across the flats  {
        }
of lambeth  {
 }
cutting  {
 }
off all escape over the bridges in its sluggish advance another bank drove over ealing and surrounded a little island  {
                  }
of survivors on castle  {
  }
hill alive but unable to escape after a fruitless  {
       }
struggle to get aboard  {
  }
a north western train at chalk farm the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods yard there ploughed  {
                   }
through shrieking people and a dozen  {
    }
stalwart  {
 }
men fought  {
 }
to keep the crowd from crushing  {
    }
the driver against his furnace  {
   }
my brother emerged upon the chalk farm road dodged  {
       }
across through a hurrying swarm of vehicles and had the luck to be foremost in the sack of a cycle  {
                  }
shop the front tire of the machine he got was punctured  {
         }
in dragging  {
 }
it through the window but he got up and off notwithstanding  {
         }
with no further injury  {
  }
than a cut wrist  {
  }
the steep foot of haverstock  {
   }
hill was impassable owing  {
  }
to several overturned horses and my brother struck into belsize  {
	  blksize :: 9
        }
road so he got out of the fury of the panic and skirting  {
           }
the edgware  {
 }
road reached edgware about seven fasting  {
    }
and wearied  {
 }
but well ahead of the crowd along the road people were standing in the roadway curious wondering he was passed by a number of cyclists some horsemen  {
                         }
and two motor  {
 }
cars  {
 }
a mile from edgware the rim of the wheel broke and the machine became unridable  {
             }
he left it by the roadside  {
    }
and trudged  {
 }
through the village there were shops half opened in the main street of the place and people crowded on the pavement  {
                   }
and in the doorways  {
  }
and windows staring astonished at this extraordinary procession of fugitives that was beginning he succeeded in getting some food at an inn for a time he remained in edgware not knowing  {
                             }
what next to do the flying people increased in number many of them like my brother seemed inclined to loiter  {
                  }
in the place there was no fresh news of the invaders from mars at that time the road was crowded but as yet far from congested  {
                        }
most of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles  {
         }
but there were soon motor cars hansom  {
     }
cabs and carriages hurrying along and the dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to st albans  {
                }
it was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to chelmsford  {
          }
where some friends of his lived that at last induced  {
        }
my brother to strike into a quiet lane running eastward presently he came upon a stile  {
              }
and crossing  {
 }
it followed a footpath northeastward  {
   }
he passed near several farmhouses  {
   }
and some little places whose names  {
    }
he did not learn he saw few fugitives until in a grass lane towards high barnet  {
              }
he happened upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers  {
        }
he came upon them just in time to save them he heard their screams  {
            }
and hurrying round the corner saw a couple of men struggling to drag them out of the little pony  {
                 }
chaise in which they had been driving while a third with difficulty held  {
           }
the frightened pony s head one of the ladies a short woman dressed in white was simply screaming the other a dark slender figure slashed at the man who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her disengaged hand my brother immediately grasped  {
                                           }
the situation shouted and hurried towards the struggle one of the men desisted and turned towards him and my brother realising from his antagonist s face that a fight was unavoidable  {
                             }
and being an expert boxer  {
   }
went into him forthwith and sent him down against the wheel of the chaise it was no time for pugilistic  {
                  }
chivalry  {
 }
and my brother laid him quiet with a kick and gripped the collar of the man who pulled  {
                }
at the slender lady  {
  }
s arm he heard the clatter of hoofs the whip stung  {
         }
across his face a third antagonist struck him between the eyes and the man he held wrenched himself free  {
                 }
and made off down the lane in the direction from which he had come partly  {
             }
stunned  {
 }
he found himself facing the man who had held the horse s head and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the lane swaying from side to side and with the women in it looking back the man before him a burly  {
                                          }
rough tried to close and he stopped him with a blow in the face then realising that he was deserted he dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise with the sturdy man close behind him and the fugitive who had turned now following remotely  {
                                              }
suddenly he stumbled and fell his immediate pursuer  {
      }
went headlong and he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again he would have had little chance against them had not the slender lady very pluckily pulled up and returned to his help it seems she had had a revolver all this time but it had been under the seat when she and her companion were attacked  {
                                                             }
she fired at six yards distance narrowly missing my brother the less courageous of the robbers  {
              }
made off and his companion followed him cursing  {
      }
his cowardice  {
 }
they both stopped in sight down the lane where the third man lay insensible take this said the slender lady and she gave my brother her revolver go back to the chaise said my brother wiping  {
                                  }
the blood from his split lip she turned without a word they were both panting and they went back to where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened pony the robbers had evidently had enough of it when my brother looked again they were retreating  {
                                              }
i ll sit here said my brother if i may and he got upon the empty front seat the lady looked over her shoulder give me the reins she said and laid the whip along the pony s side in another moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my brother s eyes so quite unexpectedly my brother found himself panting with a cut mouth a bruised jaw  {
                                                                     }
and bloodstained  {
 }
knuckles  {
 }
driving along an unknown lane with these two women he learned they were the wife and the younger sister  {
                 }
of a surgeon  {
 }
living at stanmore  {
 }
who had come in the small hours from a dangerous case at pinner  {
           }
and heard at some railway station on his way of the martian advance he had hurried home roused the women their servant had left them two days before packed some provisions  {
                             }
put his revolver under the seat luckily for my brother and told them to drive on to edgware with the idea of getting a train there he stopped behind to tell the neighbours  {
                               }
he would overtake them he said at about half past four in the morning and now it was nearly nine and they had seen nothing of him they could not stop in edgware because of the growing traffic through the place and so they had come into this side lane that was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently they stopped again nearer to new barnet he promised to stay with them at least until they could determine what to do or until the missing man arrived  {
                                                                                        }
and professed  {
 }
to be an expert shot with the revolver a weapon strange to him in order to give them confidence they made a sort of encampment by the wayside and the pony became happy in the hedge he told them of his own escape out of london and all that he knew of these martians and their ways the sun crept higher in the sky and after a time their talk died  {
                                                                     }

several wayfarers  {
 }
came along the lane and of these my brother gathered such news as he could every broken answer he had deepened  {
                   }
his impression of the great disaster  {
    }
that had come on humanity deepened his persuasion of the immediate necessity for prosecuting  {
            }
this flight he urged the matter upon them we have money said the slender woman and hesitated her eyes met my brother s and her hesitation  {
                        }
ended  {
 }
so have i said my brother she explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold besides a five pound note and suggested  {
                       }
that with that they might get upon a train at st albans or new barnet my brother thought that was hopeless seeing the fury of the londoners to crowd upon the trains and broached  {
                                }
his own idea of striking across essex  {

towards harwich  {
 }
and thence escaping from the country altogether mrs  {
      }
elphinstone  {
 }
that was the name of the woman in white would listen to no reasoning and kept calling  {
               }
upon george but her sister in law was astonishingly  {
       }
quiet and deliberate and at last agreed to my brother s suggestion so designing  {
            }
to cross the great north road they went on towards barnet my brother leading  {
            }
the pony to save it as much as possible as the sun crept up the sky the day became excessively hot and under foot a thick whitish  {
                         }
sand grew burning and blinding so that they travelled only very slowly the hedges were grey with dust and as they advanced towards barnet a tumultuous murmuring  {
                         }
grew stronger  {
 }
they began to meet more people for the most part these were staring before them murmuring indistinct questions jaded  {
                 }
haggard unclean one man in evening dress passed them on foot his eyes on the ground they heard his voice and looking back at him saw one hand clutched  {
                           }
in his hair and the other beating invisible things his paroxysm  {
         }
of rage  {
 }
over he went on his way without once looking back as my brother s party went on towards the crossroads to the south of barnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields on their left carrying a child and with two other children and then passed a man in dirty black with a thick stick in one hand and a small portmanteau in the other then round the corner of the lane from between the villas that guarded  {
                                                                               }
it at its confluence  {
  }
with the high road came a little cart drawn by a sweating  {
          }
black pony and driven by a sallow  {
     }
youth  {
 }
in a bowler  {
 }
hat grey with dust there were three girls  {
      }
east end factory  {
 }
girls and a couple of little children crowded in the cart this ll tike  {
            }
us rahnd  {
 }
edgware asked the driver wild eyed  {
    }
white faced and when my brother told him it would if he turned to the left he whipped  {
                }
up at once without the formality  {
    }
of thanks  {
 }
my brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze  {
       }
rising among the houses in front of them and veiling  {
        }
the white facade  {
 }
of a terrace beyond the road that appeared between the backs of the villas mrs elphinstone suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red flame leaping up above the houses in front of them against the hot blue sky the tumultuous noise resolved itself now into the disorderly mingling of many voices the gride of many wheels the creaking  {
                                                            }
of waggons and the staccato  {
   }
of hoofs the lane came round sharply  {
     }
not fifty yards from the crossroads good heavens cried mrs elphinstone what is this you are driving us into my brother stopped for the main road was a boiling stream of people a torrent of human beings rushing northward one pressing  {
                                       }
on another a great bank of dust white and luminous in the blaze  {
           }
of the sun made everything within twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was perpetually  {
	       perpetual :: 12
	       pertussal :: 11
	     prematurely :: 11
               }
renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses and of men and women on foot and by the wheels of vehicles of every description way my brother heard voices crying make way it was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting point of the lane and road the crowd roared  {
                                                        }
like a fire and the dust was hot and pungent and indeed a little way up the road a villa was burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road to add to the confusion two men came past them then a dirty woman carrying a heavy bundle and weeping a lost retriever  {
                                                     }
dog with hanging tongue circled  {
   }
dubiously  {
 }
round them scared and wretched and fled  {
     }
at my brother s threat so much as they could see of the road londonward between the houses to the right was a tumultuous stream of dirty hurrying people pent  {
                            }
in between the villas on either side the black heads the crowded forms grew into distinctness  {

at their horses and quarrelled  {

their pace even a man so scared and broken that his knees bent under him was galvanised  {
               }
for a moment into renewed activity the heat and dust had already been at work upon this multitude their skins  {
                  }
were dry their lips  {
  }
black and cracked they were all thirsty weary and footsore  {
        }
and amid the various cries  {
   }
one heard disputes  {
 }
reproaches  {
 }
groans  {
 }
of weariness  {
 }
and fatigue the voices of most of them were hoarse and weak through it all ran a refrain  {
                }
way way the martians are coming few stopped and came aside from that flood the lane opened slantingly into the main road with a narrow opening and had a delusive  {
                            }
appearance of coming from the direction of london yet a kind of eddy  {
           }
of people drove into its mouth weaklings  {
     }
elbowed out of the stream who for the most part rested  {
         }
but a moment before plunging  {
   }
into it again a little way down the lane with two friends bending  {
           }
over him lay a man with a bare leg wrapped about with bloody  {
           }
rags he was a lucky  {
   }
man to have friends a little old man with a grey military moustache  {
           }
and a filthy  {
 }
black frock  {
 }
coat limped  {
 }
out and sat down beside the trap removed  {
      }
his boot his sock was blood stained  {
     }
shook out a pebble  {
  }
and hobbled  {
 }
on again and then a little girl of eight or nine all alone threw herself  {
             }
under the hedge close by my brother weeping i can t go on i can t go on my brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted  {
                          }
her up speaking  {
 }
gently  {
 }
to her and carried her to miss elphinstone so soon as my brother touched her she became quite still as if frightened ellen  {

shrieked a woman in the crowd with tears in her voice ellen and the child suddenly darted away from my brother crying mother  {
                     }
they are coming said a man on horseback riding past along the lane out of the way there bawled a coachman  {
                   }
towering high and my brother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane the people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse my brother pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge and the man drove by and stopped at the turn of the way it was a carriage with a pole for a pair of horses but only one was in the traces  {
                                                                 }
my brother saw dimly through the dust that two men lifted out something on a white stretcher  {
               }
and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet  {
        }
hedge one of the men came running to my brother where is there any water he said he is dying fast and very thirsty it is lord garrick  {

                          }
lord garrick said my brother the chief justice  {
      }
the water he said there may be a tap said my brother in some of the houses we have no water i dare not leave my people the man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner house go on said the people thrusting at him they are coming go on then my brother s attention was distracted  {
                                                          }
by a bearded  {
 }
eagle  {
 }
faced man lugging a small handbag  {
    }
which split even as my brother s eyes rested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns  {
               }
that seemed to break up into separate coins as it struck the ground they rolled  {
             }
hither  {
 }
and thither  {
 }
among the struggling feet of men and horses the man stopped and looked stupidly at the heap and the shaft of a cab struck his shoulder and sent him reeling he gave a shriek and dodged back and a cartwheel  {
                                      }
shaved him narrowly way cried the men all about him make way so soon as the cab had passed he flung himself with both hands open upon the heap of coins and began thrusting handfuls  {
                                 }
in his pocket a horse rose close upon him and in another moment half rising he had been borne  {
                 }
down under the horse s hoofs stop screamed my brother and pushing a woman out of his way tried to clutch the bit of the horse before he could get to it he heard a scream under the wheels and saw through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch s back the driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother who ran round behind the cart the multitudinous  {
                                                                      }
shouting confused  {
 }
his ears the man was writhing in the dust among his scattered money unable to rise for the wheel had broken his back and his lower limbs lay limp and dead my brother stood up and yelled at the next driver and a man on a black horse came to his assistance  {
                                                  }
get him out of the road said he and clutching  {
        }
the man s collar with his free hand my brother lugged him sideways but he still clutched after his money and regarded my brother fiercely  {
                       }
hammering at his arm with a handful of gold go on go on shouted angry voices behind way way there was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed  {
                            }
into the cart that the man on horseback stopped my brother looked up and the man with the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his collar there was a concussion and the black horse came staggering sideways and the carthorse  {
                                           }
pushed beside it a hoof missed my brother s foot by a hair s breadth  {
             }
he released  {
 }
his grip on the fallen man and jumped back he saw anger  {
          }
change to terror on the face of the poor wretch on the ground and in a moment he was hidden and my brother was borne backward and carried past the entrance  {
                             }
of the lane and had to fight hard in the torrent to recover it he saw miss elphinstone covering her eyes and a little child with all a child s want of sympathetic  {
                               }
imagination staring with dilated  {
  }
eyes at a dusty  {
  }
something that lay black and still ground and crushed under the rolling wheels let us go back he shouted and began turning the pony round we cannot cross this hell  {
                            }
he said and they went back a hundred yards the way they had come until the fighting crowd was hidden as they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw the face of the dying man in the ditch under the privet deadly white and drawn and shining with perspiration the two women sat silent crouching in their seat and shivering then beyond the bend my brother stopped again miss elphinstone was white and pale and her sister in law sat weeping too wretched even to call upon george my brother was horrified  {
                                                                                            }
and perplexed so soon as they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to attempt this crossing he turned to miss elphinstone suddenly resolute  {
                         }
we must go that way he said and led the pony round again for the second time that day this girl proved her quality  {
                      }
to force their way into the torrent of people my brother plunged  {
          }
into the traffic and held back a cab horse while she drove the pony across its head a waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped  {
                        }
a long splinter from the chaise in another moment they were caught and swept forward by the stream my brother with the cabman  {
                     }
s whip marks  {
 }
red across his face and hands scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from her point the revolver at the man behind he said giving it to her if he presses  {
                              }
us too hard no point it at his horse then he began to look out for a chance of edging  {
                  }
to the right across the road but once in the stream he seemed to lose  {
             }
volition  {
 }
to become a part of that dusty rout they swept through chipping  {
          }
barnet with the torrent they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of the town before they had fought across to the opposite side of the way it was din and confusion indescribable  {
                               }
but in and beyond the town the road forks  {
       }
repeatedly  {
 }
and this to some extent relieved  {
    }
the stress they struck eastward through hadley  {
     }
and there on either side of the road and at another place farther on they came upon a great multitude of people drinking at the stream some fighting to come at the water and farther on from a lull  {
                                     }
near east barnet they saw two trains running slowly one after the other without signal or order trains swarming with people with men even among the coals  {
                         }
behind the engines going northward along the great northern  {
       }
railway my brother supposes  {
  }
they must have filled outside london for at that time the furious terror of the people had rendered  {
                }
the central  {
 }
termini  {
 }
impossible near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon for the violence of the day had already utterly  {
                   }
exhausted all three of them they began to suffer the beginnings of hunger  {
           }
the night was cold and none of them dared  {
       }
to sleep and in the evening many people came hurrying along the road nearby  {
            }
their stopping place fleeing  {
  }
from unknown dangers before them and going in the direction from which my brother had come chapter seventeen  {
                }
the thunder child had the martians aimed  {
     }
only at destruction they might on monday have annihilated the entire population of london as it spread itself slowly through the home counties  {
                     }
not only along the road through barnet but also through edgware and waltham  {
           }
abbey  {
 }
and along the roads eastward to southend  {
     }
and shoeburyness  {
 }
and south of the thames to deal and broadstairs  {

       }
poured the same frantic rout if one could have hung that june  {
          }
morning in a balloon  {
  }
in the blazing  {
 }
blue above london every northward and eastward road running out of the tangled  {
           }
maze  {
 }
of streets would have seemed stippled  {
    }
black with the streaming fugitives each dot a human agony of terror and physical distress  {
             }
i have set forth at length in the last chapter my brother s account of the road through chipping barnet in order that my readers may realise how that swarming of black dots  {
                               }
appeared to one of those concerned never before in the history of the world had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together the legendary  {

has ever seen would have been but a drop in that current  {
          }
and this was no disciplined march it was a stampede  {
        }
a stampede gigantic and terrible without order and without a goal  {
         }
six million people unarmed  {
  }
and unprovisioned  {

 }
driving headlong it was the beginning of the rout of civilisation of the massacre of mankind  {
              }
directly  {
 }
below him the balloonist  {
  }
would have seen the network of streets far and wide houses churches  {
          }
squares  {
 }
crescents  {
 }
gardens  {
 }
already derelict spread out like a huge map and in the southward blotted  {
           }
over ealing richmond wimbledon it would have seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart  {
                 }
steadily incessantly  {
 }
each black splash grew and spread shooting out ramifications  {
       }
this way and that now banking  {
    }
itself against rising ground now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new found valley exactly as a gout  {
                 }
of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper and beyond over the blue hills that rise southward of the river the glittering martians went to and fro calmly  {
                          }
and methodically spreading their poison cloud over this patch of country and then over that laying  {
              }
it again with their steam jets when it had served its purpose and taking possession of the conquered  {
                }
country they do not seem to have aimed at extermination so much as at complete demoralisation  {
	     demoralise :: 17
              }
and the destruction of any opposition they exploded any stores  {
        }
of powder they came upon cut every telegraph and wrecked the railways  {
          }
here and there they were hamstringing  {
	maistring :: 15
	hammerings :: 13
	hamstrung :: 15
	hamstring :: 18
	hamstrings :: 17
    }
mankind they seemed in no hurry to extend the field of their operations  {
           }
and did not come beyond the central part of london all that day it is possible that a very considerable number of people in london stuck to their houses through monday morning certain it is that many died at home suffocated by the black smoke until about midday the pool of london was an astonishing scene steamboats  {
                                                       }
and shipping of all sorts  {
   }
lay there tempted  {
 }
by the enormous sums  {
  }
of money offered  {
 }
by fugitives and it is said that many who swam  {
        }
out to these vessels  {
  }
were thrust off with boathooks  {
   }
and drowned about one o clock in the afternoon the thinning  {
         }
remnant  {
 }
of a cloud of the black vapour appeared between the arches  {
         }
of blackfriars  {
 }
bridge at that the pool became a scene of mad confusion fighting and collision and for some time a multitude of boats and barges  {
                      }
jammed in the northern arch of the tower bridge and the sailors and lightermen  {
            }
had to fight savagely against the people who swarmed  {
       }
upon them from the riverfront  {
   }
people were actually  {
 }
clambering down the piers  {
  }
of the bridge from above when an hour later a martian appeared beyond the clock tower and waded down the river nothing but wreckage floated  {
                       }
above limehouse  {
 }
of the falling of the fifth cylinder i have presently to tell the sixth  {
            }
star fell at wimbledon my brother keeping watch beside the women in the chaise in a meadow saw the green flash of it far beyond the hills on tuesday  {
                           }
the little party still set upon getting across the sea made its way through the swarming country towards colchester  {
                 }
the news that the martians were now in possession of the whole of london was confirmed  {
              }
they had been seen at highgate  {

	lichgate :: 8
	hesitate :: 8
	ligulate :: 8
	heritage :: 8
	digitate :: 8
	highesta :: 8
	hesitates :: 8
    }
and even it was said at neasden  {
	 deans :: 7
	  neds :: 7
     }
but they did not come into my brother s view until the morrow  {
           }
that day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need of provisions as they grew hungry  {
               }
the rights  {
 }
of property  {
 }
ceased to be regarded farmers  {
   }
were out to defend  {
  }
their cattle  {
 }
sheds granaries  {
 }
and ripening  {
 }
root  {
 }
crops  {
 }
with arms in their hands a number of people now like my brother had their faces eastward and there were some desperate souls even going back towards london to get food these were chiefly people from the northern suburbs whose knowledge  {
                                       }
of the black smoke came by hearsay he heard that about half the members  {
            }
of the government had gathered at birmingham  {
     }
and that enormous quantities of high explosives were being prepared to be used  {
           }
in automatic mines across the midland  {
    }
counties he was also told that the midland railway company had replaced the desertions  {
            }
of the first day s panic had resumed traffic and was running northward trains from st albans to relieve the congestion  {
                   }
of the home counties there was also a placard in chipping ongar  {
	      organ :: 8
	     angora :: 8
          }
announcing  {
 }
that large stores of flour were available in the northern towns and that within twenty four hours bread would be distributed among the starving people in the neighbourhood  {
	                  neighbour :: 18
                          }
but this intelligence did not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed and the three pressed eastward all day and heard no more of the bread distribution  {
                            }
than this promise nor as a matter of fact did anyone else hear more of it that night fell the seventh star falling upon primrose  {
                       }
hill it fell while miss elphinstone was watching for she took that duty  {
           }
alternately  {
 }
with my brother she saw it on wednesday  {
      }
the three fugitives they had passed the night in a field of unripe  {
           }
wheat reached chelmsford and there a body of the inhabitants calling itself the committee  {
            }

of martians at epping  {

and news of the destruction of waltham abbey powder mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders people were watching for martians here from the church towers my brother very luckily for him as it chanced preferred  {
                                       }
to push on at once to the coast  {
      }
rather than wait for food although all three of them were very hungry by midday they passed through tillingham  {
                 }
which strangely enough seemed to be quite silent and deserted save for a few furtive plunderers  {
              }
hunting for food near tillingham they suddenly came in sight of the sea and the most amazing  {
               }
crowd of shipping of all sorts that it is possible to imagine for after the sailors could no longer come up the thames they came on to the essex coast to harwich and walton and clacton  {

  }
and along the blue coast across the blackwater  {
      }
my brother could make out dimly a dense swarm of boats chaffering  {
          }
with the people on the beach a swarm which also extended up the blackwater almost to maldon  {
               }
about a couple of miles out lay an ironclad very low in the water almost to my brother s perception  {
                  }
like a water logged  {
  }
ship this was the ram thunder child it was the only warship in sight but far away to the right over the smooth  {
                     }
surface of the sea for that day there was a dead calm lay a serpent  {
             }
of black smoke to mark the next ironclads  {
      }
of the channel fleet which hovered  {
    }
in an extended line steam up and ready for action across the thames estuary  {
            }
during the course of the martian conquest  {
     }
vigilant and yet powerless  {
  }
to prevent it at the sight of the sea mrs elphinstone in spite of the assurances of her sister in law gave way to panic she had never been out of england before she would rather die than trust  {
                                     }
herself friendless  {
 }
in a foreign  {
 }
country and so forth she seemed poor woman to imagine that the french and the martians might prove very similar she had been growing increasingly  {
                       }
hysterical  {
 }
fearful and depressed during the two days journeyings  {
	journeying :: 17
      }
her great idea was to return to stanmore things had been always well and safe at stanmore they would find george at stanmore it was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the beach where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the attention of some men on a paddle steamer  {
                                                   }
from the thames they sent a boat and drove a bargain  {
         }
for thirty six pounds for the three the steamer was going these men said to ostend  {
              }
it was about two o clock when my brother having paid  {
         }
their fares  {
 }
at the gangway  {
 }
found himself safely  {
 }
aboard the steamboat with his charges  {
    }
there was food aboard albeit at exorbitant  {
     }
prices  {
 }
and the three of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats  {
             }
forward there were already a couple of score of passengers aboard some of whom had expended  {
              }
their last money in securing a passage but the captain  {
        }
lay off the blackwater until five in the afternoon picking  {
        }
up passengers until the seated decks  {
    }
were even dangerously  {
 }
crowded he would probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of guns that began about that hour in the south as if in answer the ironclad seaward  {
                             }
fired a small gun and hoisted  {
    }
a string of flags  {
  }
a jet of smoke sprang out of her funnels  {
       }
some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from shoeburyness until it was noticed that it was growing louder  {
                    }
at the same time far away in the southeast the masts  {
         }
and upperworks  {
 }
of three ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea beneath clouds of black smoke but my brother s attention speedily  {
                     }
reverted to the distant firing in the south he fancied he saw a column of smoke rising out of the distant grey haze  {
                     }
the little steamer was already flapping  {
    }
her way eastward of the big crescent of shipping and the low essex coast was growing blue and hazy  {
                 }
when a martian appeared small and faint in the remote distance advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of foulness at that the captain on the bridge swore  {
                           }
at the top of his voice with fear and anger at his own delay  {
            }
and the paddles  {
 }
seemed infected with his terror every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks  {
          }
or on the seats of the steamer and stared at that distant shape higher than the trees or church towers inland and advancing with a leisurely parody  {
                         }
of a human stride it was the first martian my brother had seen and he stood more amazed  {
                }
than terrified watching this titan advancing deliberately towards the shipping wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell away then far away beyond the crouch came another striding over some stunted  {
                                }
trees and then yet another still farther off wading deeply through a shiny  {
           }
mudflat  {
 }
that seemed to hang halfway up between sea and sky they were all stalking  {
            }
seaward as if to intercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between foulness and the naze  {
                 }
in spite of the throbbing  {
   }
exertions  {
 }
of the engines of the little paddle boat and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind her she receded with terrifying  {
                    }
slowness  {
 }
from this ominous advance glancing  {
   }
northwestward  {
 }
my brother saw the large crescent of shipping already writhing with the approaching terror one ship passing behind another another coming round from broadside  {
                      }
to end on steamships  {
  }
whistling and giving off volumes of steam sails  {
      }
being let out launches rushing hither and thither he was so fascinated by this and by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes for anything seaward and then a swift movement of the steamboat she had suddenly come round to avoid being run down flung him headlong from the seat upon which he was standing there was a shouting all about him a trampling  {
                                                                   }
of feet and a cheer that seemed to be answered faintly the steamboat lurched  {
            }
and rolled him over upon his hands he sprang to his feet and saw to starboard  {
              }
and not a hundred yards from their heeling pitching  {
       }
boat a vast iron bulk like the blade  {
      }
of a plough tearing  {
  }
through the water tossing  {
  }
it on either side in huge waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer flinging her paddles helplessly in the air and then sucking  {
                      }
her deck down almost to the waterline  {
     }
a douche  {
 }
of spray blinded my brother for a moment when his eyes were clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing landward  {
                      }
big iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure  {
       }
and from that twin  {
  }
funnels projected and spat  {
  }
a smoking blast shot with fire it was the torpedo ram thunder child steaming  {
            }
headlong coming to the rescue  {
   }
of the threatened shipping keeping his footing on the heaving  {
        }
deck by clutching the bulwarks my brother looked past this charging  {
         }
leviathan  {
 }
at the martians again and he saw the three of them now close together and standing so far out to sea that their tripod supports  {
                       }
were almost entirely submerged thus sunken and seen in remote perspective  {
         }
they appeared far less formidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake  {
           }
the steamer was pitching so helplessly it would seem they were regarding this new antagonist with astonishment to their intelligence it may be the giant was even such another as themselves the thunder child fired no gun but simply drove full speed towards them it was probably her not firing that enabled  {
                                                  }
her to get so near the enemy  {
     }
as she did they did not know what to make of her one shell and they would have sent her to the bottom forthwith with the heat ray she was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway between the steamboat and the martians a diminishing  {
	                                         diminish :: 11
                                                }
black bulk against the receding horizontal  {
    }
expanse of the essex coast suddenly the foremost martian lowered  {
        }
his tube and discharged a canister of the black gas at the ironclad it hit her larboard  {
               }
side and glanced  {
 }
off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward an unfolding  {
          }
torrent of black smoke from which the ironclad drove clear to the watchers  {
           }
from the steamer low in the water and with the sun in their eyes it seemed as though she were already among the martians they saw the gaunt figures separating  {
                            }
and rising out of the water as they retreated shoreward and one of them raised the camera like generator of the heat ray he held it pointing obliquely downward  {
                           }
and a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch it must have driven through the iron of the ship s side like a white hot iron rod through paper a flicker of flame went up through the rising steam and then the martian reeled and staggered in another moment he was cut down and a great body of water and steam shot high in the air the guns of the thunder child sounded through the reek going off one after the other and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer ricocheted  {
                                                                                               }
towards the other flying ships to the north and smashed a smack to matchwood  {
            }
but no one heeded that very much at the sight of the martian s collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately  {
                    }
and all the crowding  {
  }
passengers on the steamer s stern  {
    }
shouted together and then they yelled again for surging  {
       }
out beyond the white tumult drove something long and black the flames streaming from its middle parts  {
               }
its ventilators  {
	ventilator :: 17
 }
and funnels spouting  {
 }
fire she was alive still the steering  {
     }
gear  {
 }
it seems was intact and her engines working she headed straight for a second martian and was within a hundred yards of him when the heat ray came to bear then with a violent thud a blinding flash her decks her funnels leaped upward the martian staggered with the violence of her explosion and in another moment the flaming wreckage still driving forward with the impetus  {
                                                                }
of its pace had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing of cardboard  {
             }
my brother shouted involuntarily  {
  }
a boiling tumult of steam hid everything again two yelled the captain everyone was shouting the whole steamer from end to end rang with frantic cheering  {
                        }
that was taken up first by one and then by all in the crowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea the steam hung upon the water for many minutes hiding the third martian and the coast altogether and all this time the boat was paddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight and when at last the confusion cleared the drifting bank of black vapour intervened  {
                                                                       }
and nothing of the thunder child could be made out nor could the third martian be seen but the ironclads to seaward were now quite close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat the little vessel continued to beat its way seaward and the ironclads receded slowly towards the coast which was hidden still by a marbled  {
                                                        }
bank of vapour part steam part black gas eddying  {
       }
and combining  {
 }
in the strangest way the fleet of refugees was scattering to the northeast several smacks were sailing  {
               }
between the ironclads and the steamboat after a time and before they reached the sinking cloud bank the warships  {
                 }
turned northward and then abruptly went about and passed into the thickening haze  {
           }
of evening southward the coast grew faint and at last indistinguishable  {
         }
amid the low banks of clouds that were gathering about the sinking sun then suddenly out of the golden  {
                 }
haze  {
 }
of the sunset came the vibration  {
    }
of guns and a form of black shadows moving everyone struggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west but nothing was to be distinguished  {
                              }
clearly a mass of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of the sun the steamboat throbbed  {
               }
on its way through an interminable suspense the sun sank into grey clouds the sky flushed  {
              }
and darkened  {
 }
the evening star trembled  {
  }
into sight it was deep twilight when the captain cried out and pointed my brother strained his eyes something rushed up into the sky out of the greyness  {
                          }
rushed slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western sky something flat and broad and very large that swept round in a vast curve grew smaller sank slowly and vanished again into the grey mystery of the night and as it flew it rained down darkness upon the land book two the earth under the martians chapter one under foot in the first book i have wandered so much from my own adventures  {
                                                                              }
to tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two chapters  {
             }
i and the curate have been lurking  {
     }
in the empty house at halliford whither we fled to escape the black smoke there i will resume we stopped there all sunday night and all the next day the day of the panic in a little island of daylight cut off by the black smoke from the rest of the world we could do nothing but wait in aching  {
                                                          }
inactivity  {
 }
during those two weary days my mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife i figured  {
              }
her at leatherhead terrified in danger mourning  {
     }
me already as a dead man i paced  {
      }
the rooms and cried aloud when i thought of how i was cut off from her of all that might happen to her in my absence my cousin i knew was brave  {
                              }
enough for any emergency  {
  }
but he was not the sort of man to realise danger quickly to rise promptly  {
             }
what was needed now was not bravery  {
     }
but circumspection  {
 }
my only consolation was to believe that the martians were moving london ward  {
           }
and away from her such vague anxieties  {
     }
keep the mind sensitive  {
  }
and painful i grew very weary and irritable  {
      }
with the curate s perpetual ejaculations  {
    }
i tired of the sight of his selfish  {
      }
despair after some ineffectual remonstrance  {
   }
i kept away from him staying  {
    }
in a room evidently a children s schoolroom  {
      }
containing globes  {
 }
forms and copybooks  {
 }
when he followed me thither i went to a box room at the top of the house and in order to be alone with my aching miseries  {
                         }
locked myself in we were hopelessly  {
    }
hemmed  {
 }
in by the black smoke all that day and the morning of the next there were signs of people in the next house on sunday evening a face at a window and moving lights and later the slamming  {
                                    }
of a door but i do not know who these people were nor what became of them we saw nothing of them next day the black smoke drifted slowly riverward  {
                            }
all through monday morning creeping nearer and nearer to us driving at last along the roadway outside the house that hid us a martian came across the fields about midday laying the stuff with a jet of superheated  {
	                            superheat :: 15
                                    }
steam that hissed  {
 }
against the walls smashed all the windows it touched and scalded the curate s hand as he fled out of the front room when at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked out again the country northward was as though a black snowstorm  {
                                           }
had passed over it looking towards the river we were astonished to see an unaccountable  {
	 unrecoverable :: 12
             }
redness  {
 }
mingling with the black of the scorched meadows for a time we did not see how this change affected our position save that we were relieved of our fear of the black smoke but later i perceived that we were no longer hemmed in that now we might get away so soon as i realised that the way of escape was open my dream of action returned but the curate was lethargic  {
                                                                      }
unreasonable  {
	unreason :: 13
 }
we are safe here he repeated safe here i resolved to leave him would that i had wiser  {
                }
now for the artilleryman s teaching  {
    }
i sought  {
 }
out food and drink i had found oil and rags for my burns  {
           }
and i also took a hat and a flannel  {
       }
shirt that i found in one of the bedrooms  {
       }
when it was clear to him that i meant to go alone had reconciled  {
            }
myself to going alone he suddenly roused himself to come and all being quiet throughout the afternoon we started about five o clock as i should judge along the blackened road to sunbury in sunbury and at intervals along the road were dead bodies lying in contorted attitudes horses as well as men overturned carts and luggage  {
                                                       }
all covered thickly  {
 }
with black dust that pall of cindery powder made me think of what i had read of the destruction of pompeii  {
	               pombe :: 7
	                pome :: 7
                   }
we got to hampton court without misadventure our minds full of strange and unfamiliar appearances and at hampton court our eyes were relieved to find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating  {
                                }
drift we went through bushey park with its deer  {
       }
going to and fro under the chestnuts  {
     }
and some men and women hurrying in the distance towards hampton and so we came to twickenham  {
               }
these were the first people we saw away across the road the woods beyond ham and petersham  {
               }
were still afire  {
 }
twickenham was uninjured by either heat ray or black smoke and there were more people about here though none could give us news for the most part they were like ourselves taking advantage of a lull to shift their quarters  {
                                      }
i have an impression that many of the houses here were still occupied by scared inhabitants too frightened even for flight here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant  {
                             }
along the road i remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap pounded  {
            }
into the road by the wheels of subsequent  {
      }
carts we crossed richmond bridge about half past eight we hurried across the exposed  {
            }
bridge of course but i noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses some many feet across i did not know what these were there was no time for scrutiny and i put a more horrible interpretation  {
                                     }
on them than they deserved  {
   }
here again on the surrey side were black dust that had once been smoke and dead bodies a heap near the approach to the station but we had no glimpse of the martians until we were some way towards barnes we saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running down a side street towards the river but otherwise  {
                                                           }
it seemed deserted up the hill richmond town was burning briskly  {
         }
outside the town of richmond there was no trace of the black smoke then suddenly as we approached kew came a number of people running and the upperworks of a martian fighting machine loomed  {
                                }
in sight over the housetops  {
   }
not a hundred yards away from us we stood aghast  {
        }
at our danger and had the martian looked down we must immediately have perished  {
            }
we were so terrified that we dared not go on but turned aside and hid in a shed in a garden there the curate crouched weeping silently and refusing  {
                           }
to stir again but my fixed idea of reaching leatherhead would not let me rest and in the twilight i ventured out again i went through a shrubbery  {
                          }
and along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds  {
           }
and so emerged upon the road towards kew the curate i left in the shed but he came hurrying after me that second start was the most foolhardy  {
                          }
thing i ever did for it was manifest  {
      }
the martians were about us no sooner  {
     }
had the curate overtaken  {
  }
me than we saw either the fighting machine we had seen before or another far away across the meadows in the direction of kew lodge four or five little black figures hurried before it across the green grey of the field and in a moment it was evident this martian pursued  {
                                                 }
them in three strides he was among them and they ran radiating  {
          }
from his feet in all directions he used no heat ray to destroy them but picked them up one by one apparently he tossed  {
                      }
them into the great metallic carrier  {
    }
which projected behind him much as a workman s basket hangs  {
         }
over his shoulder it was the first time i realised that the martians might have any other purpose than destruction with defeated humanity we stood for a moment petrified then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a walled  {
                                       }
garden fell into rather than found a fortunate  {
      }
ditch and lay there scarce daring  {
    }
to whisper to each other until the stars were out i suppose it was nearly eleven o clock before we gathered courage to start again no longer venturing  {
                          }
into the road but sneaking  {
   }
along hedgerows  {
 }
and through plantations  {
 }
and watching keenly through the darkness he on the right and i on the left for the martians who seemed to be all about us in one place we blundered upon a scorched and blackened area now cooling and ashen  {
                                      }
and a number of scattered dead bodies of men burned horribly  {
         }
about the heads and trunks  {
   }
but with their legs and boots mostly intact and of dead horses fifty feet perhaps behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages sheen  {
                         }
it seemed had escaped destruction but the place was silent and deserted here we happened on no dead though the night was too dark for us to see into the side roads of the place in sheen my companion suddenly complained  {
                                       }
of faintness and thirst and we decided to try one of the houses the first house we entered  {
                }
after a little difficulty with the window was a small semi  {
         }
detached  {
 }
villa and i found nothing eatable  {
    }
left in the place but some mouldy  {
     }
cheese  {
 }
there was however water to drink and i took a hatchet  {
         }
which promised to be useful  {
   }
in our next house breaking we then crossed to a place where the road turns  {
             }
towards mortlake  {
 }
here there stood a white house within a walled garden and in the pantry of this domicile  {
               }
we found a store of food two loaves  {
      }
of bread in a pan an uncooked  {
     }
steak  {
 }
and the half of a ham i give this catalogue  {
        }
so precisely because as it happened we were destined  {
       }
to subsist  {
 }
upon this store for the next fortnight  {
     }
bottled  {
 }
beer stood under a shelf  {
   }
and there were two bags  {
   }
of haricot  {
 }
beans  {
 }
and some limp lettuces  {
  }
this pantry opened into a kind of wash  {
      }
up kitchen  {
 }
and in this was firewood  {
   }
there was also a cupboard  {
   }
in which we found nearly a dozen  {
     }
of burgundy  {
 }
tinned  {
 }
soups  {
 }
and salmon  {
 }
and two tins  {
 }
of biscuits we sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark for we dared not strike a light and ate  {
                  }
bread and ham and drank beer out of the same bottle the curate who was still timorous  {
               }
and restless was now oddly enough for pushing on and i was urging  {
           }
him to keep up his strength by eating when the thing happened that was to imprison  {
              }
us it can t be midnight yet i said and then came a blinding glare of vivid green light everything in the kitchen leaped out clearly visible in green and black and vanished again and then followed such a concussion as i have never heard before or since so close on the heels of this as to seem instantaneous  {
	                                                   instate :: 10
                                                         }
came a thud behind me a clash  {
     }
of glass a crash and rattle of falling masonry  {
       }
all about us and the plaster  {
    }
of the ceiling came down upon us smashing into a multitude of fragments upon our heads i was knocked  {
                 }
headlong across the floor against the oven  {
     }
handle  {
 }
and stunned i was insensible for a long time the curate told me and when i came to we were in darkness again and he with a face wet as i found afterwards with blood from a cut forehead was dabbing  {
                                       }
water over me for some time i could not recollect  {
        }
what had happened then things came to me slowly a bruise on my temple  {
            }
asserted  {
 }
itself are you better asked the curate in a whisper at last i answered him i sat up don t move he said the floor is covered with smashed crockery  {
                            }
from the dresser  {
 }
you can t possibly move without making a noise and i fancy they are outside we both sat quite silent so that we could scarcely hear each other breathing everything seemed deadly still but once something near us some plaster or broken brickwork  {
                                         }
slid down with a rumbling sound outside and very near was an intermittent metallic rattle that said the curate when presently it happened again yes i said but what is it a martian said the curate i listened again it was not like the heat ray i said and for a time i was inclined to think one of the great fighting machines had stumbled against the house as i had seen one stumble against the tower of shepperton church our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or four hours until the dawn came we scarcely moved and then the light filtered  {
                                                                                                       }
in not through the window which remained black but through a triangular  {
          }
aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in the wall behind us the interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly  {
                      }
for the first time the window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould which flowed over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet outside the soil was banked high against the house at the top of the window frame we could see an uprooted  {
                                                   }
drainpipe  {
	drained :: 10
	drainer :: 10
	drain :: 10
 }
the floor was littered  {
  }
with smashed hardware  {
 }
the end of the kitchen towards the house was broken into and since the daylight shone  {
              }
in there it was evident the greater part of the house had collapsed contrasting  {
	      contras :: 14
            }
vividly with this ruin was the neat dresser stained in the fashion pale green and with a number of copper  {
                  }
and tin vessels below it the wallpaper  {
     }
imitating  {
 }
blue and white tiles and a couple of coloured supplements  {
	supplement :: 14
	puzzlement :: 11
	settlement :: 11
	supplementary :: 11
        }
fluttering from the walls above the kitchen range as the dawn grew clearer  {
           }
we saw through the gap in the wall the body of a martian standing sentinel i suppose over the still glowing cylinder at the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly  {
                             }
as possible out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the scullery  {
             }
abruptly the right interpretation dawned  {
   }
upon my mind the fifth cylinder i whispered  {
      }
the fifth shot from mars has struck this house and buried us under the ruins for a time the curate was silent and then he whispered god have mercy upon us i heard him presently whimpering  {
                                  }
to himself save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery i for my part scarce dared breathe and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint light of the kitchen door i could just see the curate s face a dim oval  {
                                           }
shape and his collar and cuffs  {
    }
outside there began a metallic hammering then a violent hooting and then again after a quiet interval a hissing like the hissing of an engine these noises for the most part problematical continued intermittently and seemed if anything to increase in number as time wore  {
                                           }
on presently a measured thudding  {
   }
and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the vessels in the pantry ring and shift began and continued once the light was eclipsed  {
                        }
and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely dark for many hours we must have crouched there silent and shivering until our tired attention failed at last i found myself awake and very hungry i am inclined to believe we must have spent the greater portion of a day before that awakening  {
                                                 }
my hunger was at a stride so insistent  {
      }
that it moved me to action i told the curate i was going to seek food and felt my way towards the pantry he made me no answer but so soon as i began eating the faint noise i made stirred him up and i heard him crawling after me chapter two what we saw from the ruined house after eating we crept back to the scullery and there i must have dozed  {
                                                                       }
again for when presently i looked round i was alone the thudding vibration continued with wearisome  {
              }
persistence  {
 }
i whispered for the curate several times and at last felt my way to the door of the kitchen it was still daylight and i perceived him across the room lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the martians his shoulders were hunched  {
                                           }
so that his head was hidden from me i could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine shed and the place rocked  {
                        }
with that beating thud through the aperture in the wall i could see the top of a tree touched with gold and the warm blue of a tranquil evening sky for a minute or so i remained watching the curate and then i advanced crouching and stepping  {
                                             }
with extreme care amid the broken crockery that littered the floor i touched the curate s leg and he started so violently that a mass of plaster went sliding  {
                           }
down outside and fell with a loud impact i gripped his arm fearing he might cry out and for a long time we crouched motionless then i turned to see how much of our rampart remained the detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open in the debris and by raising myself cautiously across a beam i was able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet suburban roadway vast indeed was the change that we beheld the fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the house we had first visited  {
                                                                                                   }
the building had vanished completely smashed pulverised  {
     }
and dispersed by the blow the cylinder lay now far beneath the original foundations  {
            }
deep in a hole already vastly  {
    }
larger than the pit i had looked into at woking the earth all round it had splashed under that tremendous impact splashed is the only word and lay in heaped piles  {
                             }
that hid the masses of the adjacent houses it had behaved  {
         }
exactly like mud under the violent blow of a hammer our house had collapsed backward the front portion even on the ground floor had been destroyed completely by a chance the kitchen and scullery had escaped and stood buried now under soil and ruins closed in by tons of earth on every side save towards the cylinder over that aspect  {
                                                          }
we hung now on the very edge of the great circular pit the martians were engaged in making the heavy beating sound was evidently just behind us and ever and again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil across our peephole  {
	                                  weephole :: 7
	                                 loopholed :: 7

                                         }
the cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit and on the farther edge of the pit amid the smashed and gravel heaped shrubbery one of the great fighting machines deserted by its occupant  {
                                  }
stood stiff and tall against the evening sky at first i scarcely noticed the pit and the cylinder although it has been convenient  {
                     }
to describe them first on account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism i saw busy in the excavation and on account of the strange creatures that were crawling slowly and painfully across the heaped mould near it the mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first it was one of those complicated fabrics  {
                                                   }
that have since been called handling  {
    }
machines and the study of which has already given such an enormous impetus to terrestrial invention  {
              }
as it dawned upon me first it presented  {
      }
a sort of metallic spider with five jointed  {
      }
agile  {
 }
legs and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers  {
       }
bars  {
 }
and reaching and clutching tentacles about its body most of its arms were retracted  {
            }
but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of rods  {
           }
plates  {
 }
and bars which lined the covering and apparently strengthened  {

	strengths :: 12
	stronghead :: 11
	stringed :: 11
	strength :: 13
       }
the walls of the cylinder these as it extracted  {
       }
them were lifted out and deposited  {
    }
upon a level surface of earth behind it its motion was so swift complex  {
            }
and perfect that at first i did not see it as a machine in spite of its metallic glitter the fighting machines were coordinated  {
                      }
and animated to an extraordinary pitch but nothing to compare with this people who have never seen these structures  {
                 }
and have only the ill imagined  {
    }
efforts  {
 }
of artists  {
 }
or the imperfect  {
 }
descriptions  {
 }
of such eye witnesses  {
  }
as myself to go upon scarcely realise that living quality i recall particularly the illustration  {
             }
of one of the first pamphlets  {
    }
to give a consecutive  {
  }
account of the war the artist had evidently made a hasty study of one of the fighting machines and there his knowledge ended he presented them as tilted stiff tripods  {
                            }
without either flexibility  {
	flexibly :: 12
 }
or subtlety and with an altogether misleading  {
     }
monotony  {
 }
of effect the pamphlet containing these renderings  {
     }
had a considerable vogue  {
  }
and i mention them here simply to warn the reader against the impression they may have created  {
               }
they were no more like the martians i saw in action than a dutch doll  {
             }
is like a human being to my mind the pamphlet would have been much better without them at first i say the handling machine did not impress me as a machine but as a crablike  {
                                 }
creature with a glittering integument  {
   }
the controlling  {
 }
martian whose delicate  {
 }
tentacles actuated  {
 }
its movements seeming  {
 }
to be simply the equivalent  {
   }
of the crab s cerebral  {
   }
portion but then i perceived the resemblance of its grey brown shiny leathery  {
           }
integument to that of the other sprawling  {
     }
bodies beyond and the true nature of this dexterous  {
       }
workman dawned upon me with that realisation  {
     }
my interest shifted to those other creatures the real martians already i had had a transient impression of these and the first nausea  {
                     }
no longer obscured my observation  {
   }
moreover i was concealed  {
  }
and motionless and under no urgency  {
    }
of action they were i now saw the most unearthly  {
        }
creatures it is possible to conceive  {
    }
they were huge round bodies or rather heads about four feet in diameter each body having in front of it a face this face had no nostrils  {
                         }
indeed the martians do not seem to have had any sense of smell but it had a pair of very large dark coloured eyes and just beneath this a kind of fleshy  {
                              }
beak  {
 }
in the back of this head or body i scarcely know how to speak of it was the single tight  {
                  }
tympanic  {
 }
surface since known to be anatomically  {
	anatomical :: 15
    }
an ear though it must have been almost useless in our dense air in a group round the mouth were sixteen slender almost whiplike  {
                      }
tentacles arranged  {
 }
in two bunches  {
 }
of eight each these bunches have since been named  {
       }
rather aptly  {
 }
by that distinguished anatomist  {
  }
professor  {
 }
howes  {
 }
the hands even as i saw these martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring  {
               }
to raise themselves on these hands but of course with the increased weight of terrestrial conditions this was impossible there is reason to suppose that on mars they may have progressed upon them with some facility  {
                                  }
the internal  {
 }
anatomy i may remark here as dissection  {
     }
has since shown  {
 }
was almost equally simple  {
  }
the greater part of the structure was the brain sending enormous nerves to the eyes ear and tactile  {
                }
tentacles besides this were the bulky  {
    }
lungs into which the mouth opened and the heart and its vessels the pulmonary  {
            }
distress caused by the denser  {
   }
atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction  {
   }
was only too evident in the convulsive movements of the outer skin and this was the sum of the martian organs  {
                   }
strange as it may seem to a human being all the complex apparatus  {
           }
of digestion  {
 }
which makes  {
 }
up the bulk of our bodies did not exist in the martians they were heads merely heads entrails  {
                }
they had none they did not eat much less digest instead they took the fresh living blood of other creatures and injected  {
                    }
it into their own veins  {
   }
i have myself seen this being done as i shall mention in its place but squeamish  {
              }
as i may seem i cannot bring myself to describe what i could not endure  {
             }
even to continue watching let it suffice  {
     }
to say blood obtained  {
  }
from a still living animal in most cases from a human being was run directly by means of a little pipette  {
                   }
into the recipient  {
 }
canal the bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us but at the same time i think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous  {
                          }
habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit the physiological  {
       }
advantages  {
 }
of the practice  {
 }
of injection  {
 }
are undeniable  {
 }
if one thinks  {
 }
of the tremendous waste  {
  }
of human time and energy occasioned  {
    }
by eating and the digestive  {
   }
process our bodies are half made up of glands  {
       }
and tubes and organs occupied in turning heterogeneous  {
      }
food into blood the digestive processes  {
    }
and their reaction  {
 }
upon the nervous system  {
  }
sap our strength and colour our minds men go happy or miserable as they have healthy  {
              }
or unhealthy  {
 }
livers  {
 }
or sound gastric  {
 }
glands but the martians were lifted above all these organic fluctuations  {
         }
of mood and emotion their undeniable preference  {
     }
for men as their source of nourishment  {
     }
is partly explained by the nature of the remains  {
       }
of the victims they had brought with them as provisions from mars these creatures to judge from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands were bipeds  {
                          }
with flimsy  {
 }
silicious  {
 }
skeletons  {
 }
almost like those of the silicious sponges  {
     }
and feeble musculature  {
 }
standing about six feet high and having round erect  {
       }
heads and large eyes in flinty  {
    }
sockets  {
 }
two or three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder and all were killed before earth was reached it was just as well for them for the mere attempt to stand upright  {
                                 }
upon our planet would have broken every bone  {
      }
in their bodies and while i am engaged in this description i may add in this place certain further details which although they were not all evident to us at the time will enable the reader who is unacquainted  {
                                     }
with them to form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures in three other points their physiology  {
               }
differed  {
 }
strangely from ours their organisms  {

did not sleep any more than the heart of man sleeps  {

that periodical extinction was unknown to them they had little or no sense of fatigue it would seem on earth they could never have moved without effort yet even to the last they kept in action in twenty four hours they did twenty four hours of work as even on earth is perhaps the case with the ants in the next place wonderful as it seems in a sexual  {

off just as young lilybulbs  {

the two processes occur side by side but finally the sexual method superseded  {
           }
its competitor  {
 }
altogether on mars however just the reverse  {
     }
has apparently been the case it is worthy of remark that a certain speculative  {
            }
writer of quasi scientific repute  {
   }
writing long before the martian invasion did forecast  {
      }
for man a final structure not unlike the actual martian condition his prophecy  {
           }
i remember appeared in november  {
   }
or december  {
 }
in a long defunct  {
  }
publication  {
 }
the pall mall  {
 }
budget  {
 }
and i recall a caricature  {
   }
of it in a pre martian periodical called punch he pointed out writing in a foolish facetious  {
               }
tone that the perfection  {
  }
of mechanical appliances must ultimately  {
   }
supersede limbs the perfection of chemical devices  {
     }
digestion that such organs as hair external  {
     }
nose teeth ears and chin were no longer essential parts of the human being and that the tendency  {
                }
of natural selection  {
 }
would lie in the direction of their steady diminution  {
       }
through the coming ages  {
  }
the brain alone remained a cardinal  {
    }
necessity only one other part of the body had a strong case for survival  {
            }
and that was the hand teacher  {
    }
and agent of the brain while the rest of the body dwindled the hands would grow larger there is many a true word written in jest and here in the martians we have beyond dispute the actual accomplishment  {
                                    }
of such a suppression  {
  }
of the animal side of the organism by the intelligence to me it is quite credible  {
              }
that the martians may be descended from beings not unlike ourselves by a gradual development of brain and hands the latter giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last at the expense  {
                                 }
of the rest of the body without the body the brain would of course become a mere selfish intelligence without any of the emotional  {
                      }
substratum  {
 }
of the human being the last salient  {
     }
point in which the systems  {
   }
of these creatures differed from ours was in what one might have thought a very trivial particular micro organisms which cause so much disease  {
                      }
and pain on earth have either never appeared upon mars or martian sanitary  {
           }
science  {
 }
eliminated  {
 }
them ages ago a hundred diseases  {
    }
all the fevers  {
 }
and contagions  {
 }
of human life consumption  {
  }
cancers  {
 }
tumours  {
 }
and such morbidities  {
 }
never enter the scheme  {
  }
of their life and speaking of the differences  {
      }
between the life on mars and terrestrial life i may allude  {
         }
here to the curious suggestions  {
	outsetting :: 12
	subvention :: 12
	suggestion :: 14
	sustention :: 13
   }
of the red weed  {
  }
apparently the vegetable  {
 }
kingdom in mars instead of having green for a dominant colour is of a vivid blood red tint at any rate the seeds  {
                     }
which the martians intentionally  {
	anteriorly :: 10
	interlay :: 10
  }
or accidentally  {
	accident :: 13
	accidental :: 14
	incidental :: 14
	occidental :: 13
 }
brought with them gave rise in all cases to red coloured growths  {
          }
only that known popularly  {
  }
as the red weed however gained any footing in competition  {
	coemption :: 11
	competitor :: 11
	competence :: 11
	computing :: 11
	compotier :: 11
	competing :: 14
	competent :: 11
        }
with terrestrial forms the red creeper  {
    }
was quite a transitory  {
  }
growth and few people have seen it growing for a time however the red weed grew with astonishing vigour  {
                 }
and luxuriance  {
 }
it spread up the sides of the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment  {
	      imprisoned :: 13
	        imprison :: 13
               }
and its cactus  {
 }
like branches  {
 }
formed a carmine  {
 }
fringe to the edges  {
  }
of our triangular window and afterwards i found it broadcast  {
        }
throughout the country and especially wherever there was a stream of water the martians had what appears  {
               }
to have been an auditory  {
   }
organ a single round drum at the back of the head body and eyes with a visual  {
               }
range not very different  {
  }
from ours except that according to philips  {
	phials :: 7
     }
blue and violet were as black to them it is commonly  {
         }
supposed  {
 }
that they communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations  {
      }
this is asserted for instance in the able but hastily compiled  {
         }
pamphlet written evidently by someone  {
   }
not an eye witness of martian actions to which i have already alluded  {
           }
and which so far has been the chief source of information concerning them now no surviving  {
              }
human being saw so much of the martians in action as i did i take no credit to myself for an accident but the fact is so and i assert that i watched them closely time after time and that i have seen four five and once six of them sluggishly performing  {
                                                  }
the most elaborately  {
	elaborator :: 11
	elaborated :: 11
	elaborates :: 11
	elaborate :: 12
 }
complicated operations together without either sound or gesture their peculiar hooting invariably preceded  {
           }
feeding it had no modulation  {
   }
and was i believe in no sense a signal but merely the expiration  {
           }
of air preparatory  {
	poetastry :: 9
	precatory :: 9
	prelaty :: 9
	preparator :: 9
	predatory :: 9
	prolately :: 9
	prefatory :: 9
 }
to the suctional  {
 }
operation i have a certain claim  {
    }
to at least an elementary  {
   }
knowledge of psychology  {
 }
and in this matter i am convinced  {
     }
as firmly  {
 }
as i am convinced of anything that the martians interchanged  {
        }
thoughts without any physical intermediation  {
	intermodal :: 15
	internodal :: 12
   }
and i have been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions  {

          }
before the martian invasion as an occasional reader here or there may remember i had written with some little vehemence  {
                  }
against the telepathic  {
 }
theory  {
 }
the martians wore no clothing their conceptions  {

	confetti :: 11

     }
of ornament  {
 }
and decorum  {
 }
were necessarily different from ours and not only were they evidently much less sensible of changes  {
              }
of temperature than we are but changes of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at all seriously  {
                  }
yet though they wore no clothing it was in the other artificial additions  {
           }
to their bodily  {
 }
resources  {
 }
that their great superiority  {
  }
over man lay we men with our bicycles and road skates  {
         }
our lilienthal  {
 }
soaring  {
 }
machines our guns and sticks and so forth are just in the beginning of the evolution that the martians have worked out they have become practically mere brains  {
                          }
wearing  {
 }
different bodies according to their needs  {
    }
just as men wear suits  {
   }
of clothes and take a bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella  {
          }
in the wet and of their appliances perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact that what is the dominant feature of almost all human devices in mechanism is absent  {
                                }
the wheel is absent among all the things they brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels one would have at least expected it in locomotion  {
                              }
and in this connection  {
  }
it is curious to remark that even on this earth nature has never hit upon the wheel or has preferred other expedients  {
                    }
to its development and not only did the martians either not know of which is incredible or abstain  {
                }
from the wheel but in their apparatus singularly little use is made of the fixed pivot  {
              }
or relatively  {
 }
fixed pivot with circular motions  {
   }
thereabout  {
 }
confined to one plane almost all the joints of the machinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving over small but beautifully  {
	             beautiful :: 15
	              beautify :: 15
                     }
curved friction  {
 }
bearings  {
 }
and while upon this matter of detail it is remarkable that the long leverages  {
            }
of their machines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham  {
           }
musculature of the disks in an elastic  {
     }
sheath  {
 }
these disks become polarised  {
  }
and drawn closely and powerfully  {
   }
together when traversed  {
 }
by a current of electricity  {
	clitter :: 8
	elicitor :: 8

	glyceride :: 8

in this way the curious parallelism  {
	parellelism :: 15
    }
to animal motions which was so striking and disturbing  {
       }
to the human beholder  {
  }
was attained  {
 }
such quasi muscles abounded  {
  }
in the crablike handling machine which on my first peeping out of the slit i watched unpacking  {
               }
the cylinder it seemed infinitely more alive than the actual martians lying beyond it in the sunset light panting stirring ineffectual tentacles and moving feebly  {
                       }
after their vast journey across space while i was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight and noting  {
                 }
each strange detail of their form the curate reminded me of his presence by pulling  {
             }
violently at my arm i turned to a scowling  {
       }
face and silent eloquent lips he wanted the slit which permitted only one of us to peep through and so i had to forego  {
                      }
watching them for a time while he enjoyed  {
      }
that privilege when i looked again the busy handling machine had already put together several of the pieces  {
                }
of apparatus it had taken out of the cylinder into a shape having an unmistakable  {
             }
likeness to its own and down on the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view emitting  {
                 }
jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit excavating  {
          }
and embanking  {
 }
in a methodical and discriminating  {
   }
manner this it was which had caused the regular  {
       }
beating noise and the rhythmic  {
   }
shocks  {
 }
that had kept our ruinous  {
   }
refuge quivering it piped  {
  }
and whistled  {
 }
as it worked so far as i could see the thing was without a directing martian at all chapter three the days of imprisonment the arrival of a second fighting machine drove us from our peephole into the scullery for we feared  {
                                        }
that from his elevation the martian might see down upon us behind our barrier  {
            }
at a later date we began to feel less in danger of their eyes for to an eye in the dazzle  {
                   }
of the sunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness but at first the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery in heart throbbing retreat yet terrible as was the danger we incurred  {
                                  }
the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible  {

        }
and i recall now with a sort of wonder that in spite of the infinite danger in which we were between starvation  {
                    }
and a still more terrible death we could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of sight we would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness  {
                           }
and the dread of making a noise and strike each other and thrust and kick within a few inches  {
                 }
of exposure  {
 }
the fact is that we had absolutely incompatible  {
      }
dispositions  {

the incompatibility  {

he ate more than i did and it was in vain i pointed out that our only chance of life was to stop in the house until the martians had done with their pit that in that long patience  {
                                     }
a time might presently come when we should need food he ate and drank impulsively  {
	     impulsive :: 15
             }
in heavy meals  {

at long intervals he slept little as the days wore on his utter carelessness  {

of any consideration  {

 }
so intensified our distress and danger that i had much as i loathed  {
           }
doing it to resort to threats  {
    }
and at last to blows  {
   }
that brought him to reason for a time but he was one of those weak creatures void of pride  {
                 }
timorous anaemic  {
 }
hateful  {
 }
souls full of shifty  {
  }
cunning  {
 }
who face neither god nor man who face not even themselves it is disagreeable  {
            }
for me to recall and write these things but i set them down that my story may lack nothing those who have escaped the dark and terrible aspects  {
                          }
of life will find my brutality  {
    }
my flash of rage in our final tragedy easy  {
       }
enough to blame for they know what is wrong  {
       }
as well as any but not what is possible to tortured  {
         }
men but those who have been under the shadow who have gone down at last to elemental  {
               }
things will have a wider  {
   }
charity  {
 }
and while within we fought out our dark dim contest  {
        }
of whispers snatched food and drink and gripping  {
      }
hands and blows without in the pitiless sunlight of that terrible june was the strange wonder the unfamiliar routine of the martians in the pit let me return to those first new experiences of mine after a long time i ventured back to the peephole to find that the new comers had been reinforced  {
                                                    }
by the occupants  {
 }
of no fewer than three of the fighting machines these last had brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in an orderly manner about the cylinder the second handling machine was now completed  {
                                }
and was busied in serving  {
   }
one of the novel contrivances  {
	contrives :: 16
   }
the big machine had brought this was a body resembling a milk can in its general form above which oscillated  {
                  }
a pear  {
 }
shaped receptacle  {
 }
and from which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin  {
           }
below the oscillatory  {
	oscillator :: 14
 }
motion was imparted  {
 }
to this by one tentacle of the handling machine with two spatulate  {
          }
hands the handling machine was digging out and flinging masses of clay  {
          }
into the pear shaped receptacle above while with another arm it periodically opened a door and removed rusty and blackened clinkers  {
                   }
from the middle part of the machine another steely tentacle directed  {
         }
the powder from the basin along a ribbed  {
      }
channel towards some receiver  {
  }
that was hidden from me by the mound of bluish  {
        }
dust from this unseen receiver a little thread of green smoke rose vertically  {
           }
into the quiet air as i looked the handling machine with a faint and musical  {
             }
clinking  {
 }
extended telescopic fashion a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere blunt  {
            }
projection until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay in another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium  {
                    }
into sight untarnished  {
 }
as yet and shining dazzlingly  {
   }
and deposited it in a growing stack  {
     }
of bars that stood at the side of the pit between sunset and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a hundred such bars out of the crude  {
                            }
clay and the mound of bluish dust rose steadily until it topped  {
          }
the side of the pit the contrast between the swift and complex movements of these contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness  {
                   }
of their masters  {
 }
was acute and for days i had to tell myself repeatedly that these latter were indeed the living of the two things the curate had possession of the slit when the first men were brought to the pit i was sitting below huddled  {
                                         }
up listening with all my ears he made a sudden movement backward and i fearful that we were observed  {
                 }
crouched in a spasm of terror he came sliding down the rubbish  {
          }
and crept beside me in the darkness inarticulate gesticulating and for a moment i shared his panic his gesture suggested a resignation  {
	           designator :: 15
                    }
of the slit and after a little while my curiosity gave me courage and i rose up stepped across him and clambered up to it at first i could see no reason for his frantic behaviour the twilight had now come the stars were little and faint but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that came from the aluminium making the whole picture was a flickering scheme of green gleams  {
                                                                       }
and shifting rusty black shadows strangely trying to the eyes over and through it all went the bats  {
                }
heeding it not at all the sprawling martians were no longer to be seen the mound of blue green powder had risen to cover them from sight and a fighting machine with its legs contracted  {
                                 }
crumpled and abbreviated  {
 }
stood across the corner of the pit and then amid the clangour  {
          }
of the machinery came a drifting suspicion  {
     }
of human voices that i entertained  {

    }
at first only to dismiss i crouched watching this fighting machine closely satisfying  {
           }
myself now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a martian as the green flames lifted i could see the oily gleam of his integument and the brightness of his eyes and suddenly i heard a yell and saw a long tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the machine to the little cage  {
                                                      }
that hunched upon its back then something something struggling violently was lifted high against the sky a black vague enigma  {
                  }
against the starlight and as this black object came down again i saw by the green brightness that it was a man for an instant he was clearly visible he was a stout  {
                               }
ruddy middle aged  {
 }
man well dressed three days before he must have been walking the world a man of considerable consequence  {

                }
i could see his staring eyes and gleams of light on his studs  {
           }
and watch chain  {
 }
he vanished behind the mound and for a moment there was silence and then began a shrieking and a sustained  {
                  }
and cheerful  {
 }
hooting from the martians i slid down the rubbish struggled to my feet clapped my hands over my ears and bolted into the scullery the curate who had been crouching silently with his arms over his head looked up as i passed cried out quite loudly  {
                                            }
at my desertion of him and came running after me that night as we lurked  {
             }
in the scullery balanced  {
  }
between our horror and the terrible fascination this peeping had although i felt an urgent need of action i tried in vain to conceive some plan of escape but afterwards during the second day i was able to consider our position with great clearness the curate i found was quite incapable of discussion  {
                                                   }
this new and culminating  {
	culminated :: 14
	culminant :: 14
	culminate :: 15
  }
atrocity  {
 }
had robbed  {
 }
him of all vestiges  {
  }
of reason or forethought  {
	foregut :: 11
  }
practically he had already sunk to the level of an animal but as the saying goes  {
              }
i gripped myself with both hands it grew upon my mind once i could face the facts  {
               }
that terrible as our position was there was as yet no justification  {
          }
for absolute despair our chief chance lay in the possibility of the martians making the pit nothing more than a temporary encampment or even if they kept it permanently  {
                           }
they might not consider it necessary to guard it and a chance of escape might be afforded us i also weighed  {
                   }
very carefully  {
 }
the possibility of our digging a way out in a direction away from the pit but the chances of our emerging within sight of some sentinel fighting machine seemed at first too great and i should have had to do all the digging myself the curate would certainly have failed me it was on the third day if my memory serves  {
                                                           }
me right that i saw the lad killed it was the only occasion on which i actually saw the martians feed after that experience i avoided the hole in the wall for the better part of a day i went into the scullery removed the door and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as possible but when i had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the loose earth collapsed noisily and i did not dare continue i lost heart and lay down on the scullery floor for a long time having no spirit even to move and after that i abandoned altogether the idea of escaping by excavation it says much for the impression the martians had made upon me that at first i entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought about by their overthrow through any human effort but on the fourth or fifth night i heard a sound like heavy guns it was very late in the night and the moon was shining brightly the martians had taken away the excavating machine and save for a fighting machine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit and a handling machine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of the pit immediately beneath my peephole the place was deserted by them except for the pale glow from the handling machine and the bars and patches of white moonlight  {
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                }
the pit was in darkness and except for the clinking of the handling machine quite still that night was a beautiful serenity save for one planet the moon seemed to have the sky to herself i heard a dog howling and that familiar sound it was that made me listen then i heard quite distinctly a booming  {
                                                       }
exactly like the sound of great guns six distinct reports i counted  {
          }
and after a long interval six again and that was all chapter four the death of the curate it was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that i peeped for the last time and presently found myself alone instead of keeping close to me and trying to oust  {
                                               }
me from the slit the curate had gone back into the scullery i was struck by a sudden thought i went back quickly and quietly into the scullery in the darkness i heard the curate drinking i snatched in the darkness and my fingers caught a bottle of burgundy for a few minutes there was a tussle  {
                                                       }
the bottle struck the floor and broke and i desisted and rose we stood panting and threatening  {

	       threating :: 13
	       threaping :: 13
	       threading :: 13
	       thranging :: 11
               }
each other in the end i planted myself between him and the food and told him of my determination  {
	        determines :: 12
	        determiner :: 12
	        determined :: 12

	         determine :: 13
                 }
to begin a discipline i divided  {
    }
the food in the pantry into rations  {
     }
to last us ten days i would not let him eat any more that day in the afternoon he made a feeble effort to get at the food i had been dozing  {
                              }
but in an instant i was awake all day and all night we sat face to face i weary but resolute and he weeping and complaining of his immediate hunger it was i know a night and a day but to me it seemed it seems now an interminable length of time and so our widened  {
                                                      }
incompatibility ended at last in open conflict for two vast days we struggled in undertones  {
             }
and wrestling  {
 }
contests  {
 }
there were times when i beat and kicked him madly times when i cajoled  {
            }
and persuaded him and once i tried to bribe  {
       }
him with the last bottle of burgundy for there was a rain water pump  {
            }
from which i could get water but neither force nor kindness availed  {
          }
he was indeed beyond reason he would neither desist from his attacks  {
          }
on the food nor from his noisy babbling  {
      }
to himself the rudimentary  {
  }
precautions  {
	precaution :: 20
 }
to keep our imprisonment endurable  {
   }
he would not observe slowly i began to realise the complete overthrow of his intelligence to perceive that my sole  {
                  }
companion in this close and sickly darkness was a man insane  {
         }
from certain vague memories  {
  }
i am inclined to think my own mind wandered at times i had strange and hideous  {
              }
dreams whenever  {
 }
i slept it sounds paradoxical  {
   }
but i am inclined to think that the weakness and insanity  {
         }
of the curate warned me braced  {
    }
me and kept me a sane man on the eighth  {
        }
day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering and nothing i could do would moderate his speech  {
                }
it is just o god he would say over and over again it is just on me and mine be the punishment  {
                    }
laid we have sinned  {
  }
we have fallen short there was poverty  {
     }
sorrow  {
 }
the poor were trodden  {
  }
in the dust and i held my peace i preached  {
        }
acceptable  {
 }
folly  {
 }
my god what folly when i should have stood up though i died for it and called upon them to repent  {
                   }
repent oppressors  {
 }
of the poor and needy  {
   }
the wine press of god then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food i withheld  {
                }
from him praying  {
 }
begging  {
 }
weeping at last threatening he began to raise his voice i prayed  {
          }
him not to he perceived a hold on me he threatened he would shout and bring the martians upon us for a time that scared me but any concession  {
                           }
would have shortened  {
 }
our chance of escape beyond estimating  {
    }
i defied  {
 }
him although i felt no assurance that he might not do this thing but that day at any rate he did not he talked with his voice rising slowly through the greater part of the eighth and ninth  {
                                    }
days threats entreaties  {
 }
mingled with a torrent of half sane and always frothy  {
        }
repentance  {
 }
for his vacant sham of god s service such as made me pity him then he slept awhile  {
                }
and began again with renewed strength so loudly that i must needs make him desist be still i implored  {
                 }
he rose to his knees for he had been sitting in the darkness near the copper i have been still too long he said in a tone that must have reached the pit and now i must bear my witness woe  {
                                       }
unto  {
 }
this unfaithful  {
 }
city woe woe woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet shut up i said rising to my feet and in a terror lest  {
                                }
the martians should hear us for god s sake  {
       }
nay  {
 }
shouted the curate at the top of his voice standing likewise  {
         }
and extending his arms speak the word of the lord is upon me in three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen i must bear my witness i go it has already been too long delayed  {
                                     }
i put out my hand and felt the meat chopper  {
        }
hanging to the wall in a flash i was after him i was fierce with fear before he was halfway across the kitchen i had overtaken him with one last touch of humanity i turned the blade back and struck him with the butt  {
                                          }
he went headlong forward and lay stretched on the ground i stumbled over him and stood panting he lay still suddenly i heard a noise without the run and smash of slipping plaster and the triangular aperture in the wall was darkened i looked up and saw the lower surface of a handling machine coming slowly across the hole one of its gripping limbs curled  {
                                                               }
amid the debris another limb appeared feeling its way over the fallen beams i stood petrified staring then i saw through a sort of glass plate near the edge of the body the face as we may call it and the large dark eyes of a martian peering and then a long metallic snake of tentacle came feeling slowly through the hole i turned by an effort stumbled over the curate and stopped at the scullery door the tentacle was now some way two yards or more in the room and twisting  {
                                                                                          }
and turning with queer sudden movements this way and that for a while i stood fascinated by that slow fitful advance then with a faint hoarse cry i forced myself across the scullery i trembled violently i could scarcely stand upright i opened the door of the coal cellar and stood there in the darkness staring at the faintly lit doorway into the kitchen and listening had the martian seen me what was it doing now something was moving to and fro there very quietly every now and then it tapped  {
                                                                                         }
against the wall or started on its movements with a faint metallic ringing like the movements of keys  {
                }
on a split ring then a heavy body i knew too well what was dragged across the floor of the kitchen towards the opening irresistibly attracted i crept to the door and peeped into the kitchen in the triangle of bright outer sunlight i saw the martian in its briareus  {
                                                }
of a handling machine scrutinizing  {
	scruzing :: 14
	scrutinize :: 14
   }
the curate s head i thought at once that it would infer my presence from the mark of the blow i had given him i crept back to the coal cellar shut the door and began to cover myself up as much as i could and as noiselessly as possible in the darkness among the firewood and coal therein  {
                                                         }
every now and then i paused  {
    }
rigid to hear if the martian had thrust its tentacles through the opening again then the faint metallic jingle  {
                 }
returned i traced  {
 }
it slowly feeling over the kitchen presently i heard it nearer in the scullery as i judged i thought that its length might be insufficient  {
                       }
to reach me i prayed copiously  {
    }
it passed scraping faintly across the cellar door an age of almost intolerable  {
	  intolerant :: 14
           }
suspense intervened then i heard it fumbling  {
     }
at the latch it had found the door the martians understood doors it worried at the catch for a minute perhaps and then the door opened in the darkness i could just see the thing like an elephant  {
                                    }
s trunk more than anything else waving towards me and touching  {
         }
and examining  {
 }
the wall coals wood and ceiling it was like a black worm  {
          }
swaying its blind head to and fro once even it touched the heel of my boot i was on the verge of screaming i bit my hand for a time the tentacle was silent i could have fancied it had been withdrawn presently with an abrupt click  {
                                             }
it gripped something i thought it had me and seemed to go out of the cellar again for a minute i was not sure apparently it had taken a lump of coal to examine  {
                                }
i seized  {
 }
the opportunity of slightly shifting my position which had become cramped  {
         }
and then listened i whispered passionate prayers  {
     }
for safety then i heard the slow deliberate sound creeping towards me again slowly slowly it drew near scratching  {
                 }
against the walls and tapping  {
   }
the furniture while i was still doubtful it rapped smartly  {
        }
against the cellar door and closed it i heard it go into the pantry and the biscuit tins rattled and a bottle smashed and then came a heavy bump  {
                           }
against the cellar door then silence that passed into an infinity  {
         }
of suspense had it gone at last i decided that it had it came into the scullery no more but i lay all the tenth day in the close darkness buried among coals and firewood not daring even to crawl out for the drink for which i craved  {
                                              }
it was the eleventh  {
  }
day before i ventured so far from my security chapter five the stillness my first act before i went into the pantry was to fasten the door between the kitchen and the scullery but the pantry was empty every scrap of food had gone apparently the martian had taken it all on the previous day at that discovery  {
                                                        }
i despaired  {
 }
for the first time i took no food or no drink either on the eleventh or the twelfth day at first my mouth and throat were parched  {
                         }
and my strength ebbed  {
  }
sensibly  {
 }
i sat about in the darkness of the scullery in a state of despondent  {
            }
wretchedness my mind ran on eating i thought i had become deaf for the noises of movement i had been accustomed to hear from the pit had ceased absolutely i did not feel strong enough to crawl noiselessly to the peephole or i would have gone there on the twelfth day my throat was so painful that taking the chance of alarming  {
                                                            }
the martians i attacked the creaking rain water pump that stood by the sink and got a couple of glassfuls  {
                  }
of blackened and tainted  {
  }
rain water i was greatly refreshed  {
    }
by this and emboldened  {
  }
by the fact that no enquiring  {
    }
tentacle followed the noise of my pumping  {
     }
during these days in a rambling  {
    }
inconclusive  {
 }
way i thought much of the curate and of the manner of his death on the thirteenth  {
               }
day i drank some more water and dozed  {
      }
and thought disjointedly  {
 }
of eating and of vague impossible plans of escape whenever i dozed  {
          }
i dreamt  {
 }
of horrible phantasms  {
 }
of the death of the curate or of sumptuous  {
       }
dinners  {
 }
but asleep  {
 }
or awake i felt a keen pain that urged me to drink again and again the light that came into the scullery was no longer grey but red to my disordered imagination it seemed the colour of blood on the fourteenth  {
                                       }
day i went into the kitchen and i was surprised to find that the fronds  {
             }
of the red weed had grown right across the hole in the wall turning the half light of the place into a crimson coloured obscurity it was early on the fifteenth  {
                             }
day that i heard a curious familiar sequence  {
      }
of sounds in the kitchen and listening identified  {
      }
it as the snuffing  {
  }
and scratching of a dog going into the kitchen i saw a dog s nose peering in through a break among the ruddy fronds this greatly surprised me at the scent of me he barked  {
                                 }
shortly  {
 }
i thought if i could induce him to come into the place quietly i should be able perhaps to kill and eat him and in any case it would be advisable  {
                             }
to kill him lest his actions attracted the attention of the martians i crept forward saying good dog very softly but he suddenly withdrew his head and disappeared i listened i was not deaf but certainly the pit was still i heard a sound like the flutter of a bird s wings  {
                                                  }
and a hoarse croaking  {
  }
but that was all for a long while i lay close to the peephole but not daring to move aside the red plants  {
                     }
that obscured it once or twice i heard a faint pitter  {
         }
patter  {
 }
like the feet of the dog going hither and thither on the sand far below me and there were more birdlike  {
                   }
sounds but that was all at length encouraged  {
      }
by the silence i looked out except in the corner where a multitude of crows  {
             }
hopped  {
 }
and fought over the skeletons of the dead the martians had consumed there was not a living thing in the pit i stared about me scarcely believing  {
                         }
my eyes all the machinery had gone save for the big mound of greyish blue powder in one corner certain bars of aluminium in another the black birds and the skeletons of the killed the place was merely an empty circular pit in the sand slowly i thrust myself out through the red weed and stood upon the mound of rubble  {
                                                           }
i could see in any direction save behind me to the north and neither martians nor sign of martians were to be seen the pit dropped sheerly  {
                         }
from my feet but a little way along the rubbish afforded a practicable  {
           }
slope to the summit of the ruins my chance of escape had come i began to tremble i hesitated for some time and then in a gust of desperate resolution  {
                            }
and with a heart that throbbed violently i scrambled to the top of the mound in which i had been buried so long i looked about again to the northward too no martian was visible when i had last seen this part of sheen in the daylight it had been a straggling  {
                                                  }
street of comfortable  {
 }
white and red houses interspersed  {
	inters :: 12
	interp :: 11
	interspace :: 11
	interposed :: 11
   }
with abundant shady  {
 }
trees now i stood on a mound of smashed brickwork clay and gravel over which spread a multitude of red cactus shaped plants knee high without a solitary terrestrial growth to dispute their footing the trees near me were dead and brown but further a network of red thread scaled  {
                                                }
the still living stems the neighbouring houses had all been wrecked but none had been burned their walls stood sometimes to the second story with smashed windows and shattered doors the red weed grew tumultuously in their roofless  {
                                    }
rooms below me was the great pit with the crows struggling for its refuse a number of other birds hopped about among the ruins far away i saw a gaunt cat slink  {
                              }
crouchingly  {
 }
along a wall but traces of men there were none the day seemed by contrast with my recent confinement  {
                 }
dazzlingly  {
 }
bright the sky a glowing blue a gentle breeze  {
       }
kept the red weed that covered every scrap of unoccupied  {
        }
ground gently swaying and oh  {
   }
the sweetness  {
 }
of the air chapter six the work of fifteen days for some time i stood tottering  {
              }
on the mound regardless  {
  }
of my safety within that noisome  {
    }
den from which i had emerged i had thought with a narrow intensity only of our immediate security i had not realised what had been happening to the world had not anticipated  {

	                     anticipate :: 11
                              }
this startling vision of unfamiliar things i had expected to see sheen in ruins i found about me the landscape weird and lurid of another planet for that moment i touched an emotion beyond the common range of men yet one that the poor brutes we dominate  {
                                             }
know only too well i felt as a rabbit might feel returning to his burrow  {
             }
and suddenly confronted  {
 }
by the work of a dozen  {
    }
busy navvies  {
 }
digging the foundations of a house i felt the first inkling  {
         }
of a thing that presently grew quite clear in my mind that oppressed me for many days a sense of dethronement  {

                   }
a persuasion that i was no longer a master but an animal among the animals under the martian heel with us it would be as with them to lurk and watch to run and hide the fear and empire of man had passed away but so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed and my dominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast in the direction away from the pit i saw beyond a red covered wall a patch of garden ground unburied  {
                                                                                      }
this gave me a hint  {
   }
and i went knee deep and sometimes neck deep in the red weed the density  {
             }
of the weed gave me a reassuring sense of hiding the wall was some six feet high and when i attempted to clamber it i found i could not lift my feet to the crest so i went along by the side of it and came to a corner and a rockwork  {
	                                              rocky :: 7

                                                  }
that enabled me to get to the top and tumble  {
        }
into the garden i coveted  {
   }
here i found some young onions  {
    }
a couple of gladiolus  {
  }
bulbs  {
 }
and a quantity of immature  {
   }
carrots  {
 }
all of which i secured and scrambling over a ruined wall went on my way through scarlet  {
               }
and crimson trees towards kew it was like walking through an avenue  {
          }
of gigantic blood drops  {
  }
possessed with two ideas to get more food and to limp as soon and as far as my strength permitted out of this accursed  {
                      }
unearthly region of the pit some way farther in a grassy  {
         }
place was a group of mushrooms  {
    }
which also i devoured  {
  }
and then i came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow water where meadows used to be these fragments of nourishment served only to whet my hunger at first i was surprised at this flood in a hot dry summer but afterwards i discovered that it was caused by the tropical  {
                                                 }
exuberance  {
 }
of the red weed directly this extraordinary growth encountered  {
       }

   }
fecundity  {
 }
its seeds were simply poured down into the water of the wey and thames and its swiftly growing and titanic  {
                  }
water fronds speedily choked  {
  }
both those rivers  {
 }
at putney as i afterwards saw the bridge was almost lost in a tangle of this weed and at richmond too the thames water poured in a broad and shallow stream across the meadows of hampton and twickenham as the water spread the weed followed them until the ruined villas of the thames valley were for a time lost in this red swamp  {
                                                             }
whose margin i explored  {
  }
and much of the desolation the martians had caused was concealed in the end the red weed succumbed  {
                }
almost as quickly as it had spread a cankering  {
       }
disease due it is believed to the action of certain bacteria  {
         }
presently seized  {
 }
upon it now by the action of natural selection all terrestrial plants have acquired  {
            }
a resisting  {
 }
power against bacterial  {
 }
diseases they never succumb without a severe  {
     }
struggle but the red weed rotted  {
    }
like a thing already dead the fronds became bleached  {
       }
and then shrivelled and brittle they broke off at the least touch and the waters  {
             }
that had stimulated  {
 }
their early growth carried their last vestiges out to sea my first act on coming to this water was of course to slake  {
                     }
my thirst i drank a great deal of it and moved by an impulse gnawed some fronds of red weed but they were watery  {
                      }
and had a sickly metallic taste  {
    }
i found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to wade securely although the red weed impeded  {
               }
my feet a little but the flood evidently got deeper  {
        }
towards the river and i turned back to mortlake i managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins of its villas and fences and lamps and so presently i got out of this spate  {
                                   }
and made my way to the hill going up towards roehampton  {
         }
and came out on putney common here the scenery  {
       }
changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the wreckage of the familiar patches of ground exhibited  {
              }
the devastation  {
 }
of a cyclone  {
 }
and in a few score yards i would come upon perfectly undisturbed  {
	 unsistered :: 14
          }
spaces  {
 }
houses with their blinds  {
  }
trimly  {
 }
drawn and doors closed as if they had been left for a day by the owners  {
              }
or as if their inhabitants slept within the red weed was less abundant the tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper i hunted  {
                         }
for food among the trees finding nothing and i also raided  {
         }
a couple of silent houses but they had already been broken into and ransacked  {
            }
i rested for the remainder  {
   }
of the daylight in a shrubbery being in my enfeebled  {
        }
condition too fatigued  {
 }
to push on all this time i saw no human beings and no signs of the martians i encountered a couple of hungry looking dogs  {
                       }
but both hurried circuitously  {
  }
away from the advances i made them near roehampton i had seen two human skeletons not bodies but skeletons picked clean and in the wood by me i found the crushed and scattered bones  {
                                }
of several cats  {
 }
and rabbits  {
 }
and the skull  {
 }
of a sheep but though i gnawed parts of these in my mouth there was nothing to be got from them after sunset i struggled on along the road towards putney where i think the heat ray must have been used for some reason and in the garden beyond roehampton i got a quantity of immature potatoes  {
                                                       }
sufficient to stay my hunger from this garden one looked down upon putney and the river the aspect of the place in the dusk was singularly desolate blackened trees blackened desolate ruins and down the hill the sheets of the flooded  {
                                       }
river red tinged  {
 }
with the weed and over all silence it filled me with indescribable terror to think how swiftly that desolating  {
                 }
change had come for a time i believed that mankind had been swept out of existence and that i stood there alone the last man left alive hard by the top of putney hill i came upon another skeleton with the arms dislocated  {
                                         }
and removed several yards from the rest of the body as i proceeded i became more and more convinced that the extermination of mankind was save for such stragglers  {
                           }
as myself already accomplished  {
  }
in this part of the world the martians i thought had gone on and left the country desolated seeking food elsewhere  {
                   }
perhaps even now they were destroying berlin  {
     }
or paris  {
	saris :: 8
	pairs :: 8
	parison :: 8
	parish :: 9
 }
or it might be they had gone northward chapter seven the man on putney hill i spent that night in the inn that stands  {
                      }
at the top of putney hill sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to leatherhead i will not tell the needless  {
                        }
trouble i had breaking into that house afterwards i found the front door was on the latch nor how i ransacked every room for food until just on the verge of despair in what seemed to me to be a servant s bedroom i found a rat gnawed crust  {
                                               }
and two tins of pineapple  {
   }
the place had been already searched  {
    }
and emptied  {
 }
in the bar i afterwards found some biscuits and sandwiches  {
        }
that had been overlooked the latter i could not eat they were too rotten  {
            }
but the former not only stayed  {
    }
my hunger but filled my pockets i lit no lamps fearing some martian might come beating that part of london for food in the night before i went to bed i had an interval of restlessness  {

and prowled from window to window peering out for some sign of these monsters i slept little as i lay in bed i found myself thinking  {
                        }
consecutively  {
 }
a thing i do not remember to have done since my last argument  {
           }

time my mental condition had been a hurrying succession of vague emotional states  {
           }
or a sort of stupid receptivity  {
	receptive :: 13
    }
but in the night my brain reinforced i suppose by the food i had eaten grew clear again and i thought three things struggled for possession of my mind the killing of the curate the whereabouts  {
	                         whereabout :: 17
                                  }
of the martians and the possible fate of my wife the former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse  {
                  }
to recall i saw it simply as a thing done a memory infinitely disagreeable but quite without the quality of remorse i saw myself then as i see myself now driven step by step towards that hasty blow the creature of a sequence of accidents  {
                                           }
leading inevitably to that i felt no condemnation  {
      }
yet the memory static  {
  }
unprogressive  {
 }
haunted  {
 }
me in the silence of the night with that sense of the nearness  {
           }
of god that sometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness i stood my trial  {
             }
my only trial for that moment of wrath  {
      }
and fear i retraced  {
  }
every step of our conversation from the moment when i had found him crouching beside me heedless  {
               }
of my thirst and pointing to the fire and smoke that streamed up from the ruins of weybridge we had been incapable of co operation grim  {
                        }
chance had taken no heed of that had i foreseen  {
        }
i should have left him at halliford but i did not foresee and crime  {
            }
is to foresee and do and i set this down as i have set all this story down as it was there were no witnesses all these things i might have concealed but i set it down and the reader must form his judgment  {
                                          }
as he will and when by an effort i had set aside that picture of a prostrate body i faced the problem of the martians and the fate of my wife for the former i had no data  {
                                    }
i could imagine a hundred things and so unhappily  {
       }
i could for the latter and suddenly that night became terrible i found myself sitting up in bed staring at the dark i found myself praying that the heat ray might have suddenly and painlessly  {
                                 }
struck her out of being since the night of my return from leatherhead i had not prayed i had uttered  {
                  }
prayers fetish  {
 }
prayers had prayed as heathens  {
   }
mutter charms  {
 }
when i was in extremity  {
   }
but now i prayed indeed pleading  {
    }
steadfastly and sanely  {
 }
face to face with the darkness of god strange night strangest in this that so soon as dawn had come i who had talked with god crept out of the house like a rat leaving its hiding place a creature scarcely larger an inferior animal a thing that for any passing whim of our masters might be hunted and killed perhaps they also prayed confidently  {
                                                               }
to god surely if we have learned nothing else this war has taught  {
           }
us pity pity for those witless  {
    }
souls that suffer our dominion  {
   }
the morning was bright and fine  {
    }
and the eastern sky glowed pink and was fretted  {
       }
with little golden clouds in the road that runs from the top of putney hill to wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of the panic torrent that must have poured londonward on the sunday night after the fighting began there was a little two wheeled  {
                                            }
cart inscribed  {

greengrocer new malden with a smashed wheel and an abandoned tin trunk there was a straw hat trampled into the now hardened mud and at the top of west hill a lot of blood stained glass about the overturned water trough my movements were languid  {
                                           }
my plans of the vaguest i had an idea of going to leatherhead though i knew that there i had the poorest  {
                    }
chance of finding my wife certainly unless death had overtaken them suddenly my cousins and she would have fled thence but it seemed to me i might find or learn there whither the surrey people had fled i knew i wanted to find my wife that my heart ached  {
                                               }
for her and the world of men but i had no clear idea how the finding might be done i was also sharply aware now of my intense loneliness  {
                           }
from the corner i went under cover of a thicket  {
        }
of trees and bushes to the edge of wimbledon common stretching wide and far that dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse  {
                      }
and broom  {
 }
there was no red weed to be seen and as i prowled hesitating on the verge of the open the sun rose flooding  {
                     }
it all with light and vitality  {
    }
i came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy  {
          }
place among the trees i stopped to look at them drawing a lesson from their stout resolve to live and presently turning suddenly with an odd feeling of being watched i beheld something crouching amid a clump of bushes i stood regarding this i made a step towards it and it rose up and became a man armed with a cutlass  {
                                                           }
i approached him slowly he stood silent and motionless regarding me as i drew nearer i perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and filthy as my own he looked indeed as though he had been dragged through a culvert  {
                                       }
nearer i distinguished the green slime  {
    }
of ditches mixing  {
 }
with the pale drab  {
  }
of dried  {
 }
clay and shiny coaly  {
  }
patches his black hair fell over his eyes and his face was dark and dirty and sunken so that at first i did not recognise him there was a red cut across the lower part of his face stop he cried when i was within ten yards of him and i stopped his voice was hoarse where do you come from he said i thought surveying him i come from mortlake i said i was buried near the pit the martians made about their cylinder i have worked my way out and escaped there is no food about here he said this is my country all this hill down to the river and back to clapham  {
                                                                                                                  }
and up to the edge of the common there is only food for one which way are you going i answered slowly i don t know i said i have been buried in the ruins of a house thirteen or fourteen days i don t know what has happened he looked at me doubtfully then started and looked with a changed expression i ve no wish to stop about here said i i think i shall go to leatherhead for my wife was there he shot out a pointing finger it is you said he the man from woking and you weren  {
                                                                                                    }
t killed at weybridge i recognised  {
    }
him at the same moment you are the artilleryman who came into my garden good luck he said we are lucky ones  {
                    }
fancy you he put out a hand and i took it i crawled up a drain he said but they didn t kill everyone and after they went away i got off towards walton across the fields but it s not sixteen days altogether and your hair is grey he looked over his shoulder suddenly only a rook  {
                                                        }
he said one gets  {
  }
to know that birds have shadows these days this is a bit open let us crawl under those bushes and talk have you seen any martians i said since i crawled out they ve gone away across london he said i guess they ve got a bigger  {
                                             }
camp  {
 }
there of a night all over there hampstead way the sky is alive with their lights it s like a great city and in the glare you can just see them moving by daylight you can t but nearer i haven t seen them he counted on his fingers five days then i saw a couple across hammersmith  {
	                                               mastership :: 12
                                                        }
way carrying something big and the night before last he stopped and spoke impressively  {
            }
it was just a matter of lights but it was something up in the air i believe they ve built a flying machine and are learning to fly i stopped on hands and knees for we had come to the bushes fly yes he said fly i went on into a little bower  {
                                                   }
and sat down it is all over with humanity i said if they can do that they will simply go round the world he nodded  {
                       }
they will but it will relieve things over here a bit and besides he looked at me aren t you satisfied  {
                   }
it is up with humanity i am we re down we re beat i stared strange as it may seem i had not arrived at this fact a fact perfectly obvious so soon as he spoke i had still held a vague hope rather i had kept a lifelong  {
                                               }
habit of mind he repeated his words we re beat they carried absolute conviction  {
            }
it s all over he said they ve lost one just one and they ve made their footing good and crippled the greatest power in the world they ve walked over us the death of that one at weybridge was an accident and these are only pioneers they kept on coming these green stars i ve seen none these five or six days but i ve no doubt they re falling somewhere every night nothing s to be done we re under we re beat i made him no answer i sat staring before me trying in vain to devise  {
                                                                                                  }
some countervailing  {
 }
thought this isn  {
 }
t a war said the artilleryman it never was a war any more than there s war between man and ants suddenly i recalled  {
                      }
the night in the observatory after the tenth shot they fired no more at least until the first cylinder came how do you know said the artilleryman i explained he thought something wrong with the gun he said but what if there is they ll get it right again and even if there s a delay how can it alter the end it s just men and ants there s the ants builds  {
                                                                       }
their cities  {
 }
live their lives have wars revolutions  {
    }
until the men want them out of the way and then they go out of the way that s what we are now just ants only yes i said we re eatable ants we sat looking at each other and what will they do with us i said that s what i ve been thinking he said that s what i ve been thinking after weybridge i went south thinking i saw what was up most of the people were hard at it squealing  {
                                                                                  }
and exciting themselves but i m not so fond  {
       }
of squealing i ve been in sight of death once or twice i m not an ornamental  {
               }
soldier and at the best and worst death it s just death and it s the man that keeps  {
                 }
on thinking comes through i saw everyone tracking  {
      }
away south says i food won t last this way and i turned right back i went for the martians like a sparrow  {
                     }
goes for man all round he waved a hand to the horizon  {
          }
they re starving in heaps bolting  {
    }
treading on each other he saw my face and halted awkwardly  {
         }
no doubt lots  {
 }
who had money have gone away to france  {
	  franc :: 10
      }
he said he seemed to hesitate whether to apologise  {
       }
met my eyes and went on there s food all about here canned  {
           }
things in shops wines  {
  }
spirits  {
 }
mineral  {
 }
waters and the water mains and drains  {
     }
are empty well i was telling you what i was thinking here s intelligent things i said and it seems they want us for food first they ll smash us up ships machines guns cities all the order and organisation all that will go if we were the size  {
                                               }
of ants we might pull through but we re not it s all too bulky to stop that s the first certainty  {
                    }
eh i assented  {
 }
it is i ve thought it out very well then next at present we re caught as we re wanted a martian has only to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run and i saw one one day out by wandsworth  {
                                           }
picking houses to pieces and routing  {
    }
among the wreckage but they won t keep on doing that so soon as they ve settled all our guns and ships and smashed our railways and done all the things they are doing over there they will begin catching  {
                                      }
us systematic  {
 }
picking the best and storing  {
   }
us in cages  {
 }
and things that s what they will start doing in a bit lord they haven t begun on us yet don t you see that not begun i exclaimed not begun all that s happened so far is through our not having the sense to keep quiet worrying  {
                                              }
them with guns and such foolery  {
    }
and losing our heads and rushing off in crowds  {
       }
to where there wasn  {
  }
t any more safety than where we were they don t want to bother  {
            }
us yet they re making their things making all the things they couldn  {
           }
t bring with them getting things ready for the rest of their people very likely  {
             }
that s why the cylinders have stopped for a bit for fear of hitting  {
            }
those who are here and instead of our rushing about blind on the howl or getting dynamite  {
               }
on the chance of busting  {
   }
them up we ve got to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs that s how i figure it out it isn t quite according to what a man wants for his species but it s about what the facts point to and that s the principle  {
                                                }
i acted  {
 }
upon cities nations  {
 }
civilisation progress it s all over that game  {
      }
s up we re beat but if that is so what is there to live for the artilleryman looked at me for a moment there won t be any more blessed concerts  {
                              }
for a million years or so there won t be any royal academy  {
           }
of arts  {
 }
and no nice little feeds  {

if it s amusement  {
  }
you re after i reckon  {
   }
the game is up if you ve got any drawing room manners  {
          }
or a dislike  {
 }
to eating peas  {
 }
with a knife  {
 }
or dropping aitches  {
 }
you d better chuck  {
  }
em away they ain t no further use you mean i mean that men like me are going on living for the sake of the breed  {
                        }
i tell you i m grim set on living and if i m not mistaken  {
             }
you ll show what insides  {
   }
you ve got too before long we aren t going to be exterminated  {
           }
and i don t mean to be caught either and tamed  {
         }
and fattened  {
 }
and bred  {
 }
like a thundering  {
 }
ox ugh  {
 }
fancy those brown creepers  {
  }
you don t mean to say i do i m going on under their feet i ve got it planned  {
                  }
i ve thought it out we men are beat we don t know enough we ve got to learn before we ve got a chance and we ve got to live and keep independent  {
                                }
while we learn see that s what has to be done i stared astonished and stirred profoundly  {
               }
by the man s resolution great god cried i but you are a man indeed and suddenly i gripped his hand eh he said with his eyes shining i ve thought it out eh go on i said well those who mean to escape their catching must get ready i m getting ready mind you it isn t all of us that are made for wild beasts and that s what it s got to be that s why i watched you i had my doubts  {
                                                                                    }
you re slender i didn t know that it was you you see or just how you d been buried all these the sort of people that lived in these houses and all those damn  {
                                 }
little clerks that used to live down that way they d be no good they haven t any spirit in them no proud  {
                     }
dreams and no proud lusts  {
   }
and a man who hasn t one or the other lord what is he but funk  {
              }
and precautions they just used to skedaddle  {
     }
off to work i ve seen hundreds of em bit of breakfast in hand running wild and shining to catch their little season ticket  {
                      }
train for fear they d get dismissed  {
     }
if they didn t working at businesses  {
     }
they were afraid to take the trouble to understand skedaddling  {
        }
back for fear they wouldn  {
   }
t be in time for dinner keeping indoors  {
      }
after dinner for fear of the back streets and sleeping with the wives they married  {
             }
not because they wanted them but because they had a bit of money that would make for safety in their one little miserable skedaddle through the world lives insured  {
                           }
and a bit invested  {
  }
for fear of accidents and on sundays  {
	sunray :: 9
	sundry :: 9
	sunday :: 12
	sundae :: 9
     }
fear of the hereafter  {
  }
as if hell was built for rabbits well the martians will just be a godsend  {
             }
to these nice roomy  {
  }
cages fattening  {
 }
food careful breeding  {
 }
no worry after a week  {
   }
or so chasing  {
 }
about the fields and lands on empty stomachs  {
      }
they ll come and be caught cheerful they ll be quite glad after a bit they ll wonder what people did before there were martians to take care of them and the bar loafers and mashers  {
                                  }
and singers  {
 }
i can imagine them i can imagine them he said with a sort of sombre  {
             }
gratification  {
 }
there ll be any amount of sentiment  {
     }
and religion loose among them there s hundreds of things i saw with my eyes that i ve only begun to see clearly these last few days there s lots will take things as they are fat and stupid and lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it s all wrong and that they ought to be doing something now whenever things are so that a lot of people feel they ought to be doing something the weak and those who go weak with a lot of complicated thinking always make for a sort of do nothing religion very pious  {
                                                                                                     }
and superior and submit  {
  }
to persecution  {
 }
and the will of the lord very likely you ve seen the same thing it s energy in a gale  {
                  }
of funk and turned clean inside out these cages will be full of psalms  {
            }
and hymns  {
 }
and piety  {
 }
and those of a less simple sort will work in a bit of what is it eroticism  {
               }
he paused very likely these martians will make pets  {
       }
of some of them train them to do tricks  {
       }
who knows get sentimental  {
	septimal :: 11
	mentalisms :: 11
	mentalism :: 11
  }
over the pet boy who grew up and had to be killed and some maybe they will train to hunt us no i cried that s impossible no human being what s the good of going on with such lies  {
                                      }
said the artilleryman there s men who d do it cheerful what nonsense to pretend  {
             }
there isn t and i succumbed to his conviction if they come after me he said lord if they come after me and subsided  {
                      }
into a grim meditation  {
  }
i sat contemplating  {
 }
these things i could find nothing to bring against this man s reasoning in the days before the invasion no one would have questioned  {
                      }
my intellectual superiority to his i a professed and recognised writer on philosophical themes  {
            }
and he a common soldier and yet he had already formulated  {
         }
a situation that i had scarcely realised what are you doing i said presently what plans have you made he hesitated well it s like this he said what have we to do we have to invent a sort of life where men can live and breed and be sufficiently secure to bring the children up yes wait a bit and i ll make it clearer what i think ought to be done the tame ones will go like all tame beasts in a few generations  {
	                                                                           generation :: 14
                                                                                    }
they ll be big beautiful rich blooded  {
     }
stupid rubbish the risk  {
  }
is that we who keep wild will go savage degenerate  {
        }
into a sort of big savage rat you see how i mean to live is underground i ve been thinking about the drains of course those who don t know drains think horrible things but under this london are miles and miles hundreds of miles and a few days rain and london empty will leave them sweet and clean the main drains are big enough and airy  {
                                                                 }
enough for anyone then there s cellars vaults  {
      }
stores from which bolting passages  {
   }
may be made to the drains and the railway tunnels  {
        }
and subways  {
 }
eh you begin to see and we form a band  {
        }
able bodied  {
 }
clean minded men we re not going to pick up any rubbish that drifts  {
            }
in weaklings go out again as you meant me to go well i parleyed  {
            }
didn t i we won t quarrel about that go on those who stop obey  {
             }
orders  {
 }
able bodied clean minded women we want also mothers  {
       }
and teachers  {

ladies no blasted rolling eyes we can t have any weak or silly life is real again and the useless and cumbersome  {
                    }
and mischievous  {
 }
have to die they ought to die they ought to be willing  {
          }
to die it s a sort of disloyalty  {
      }
after all to live and taint the race and they can t be happy moreover dying s none so dreadful it s the funking  {
                      }
makes it bad  {
 }
and in all those places we shall gather our district will be london and we may even be able to keep a watch and run about in the open when the martians keep away play cricket  {
                                  }
perhaps that s how we shall save the race eh it s a possible thing but saving  {
               }
the race is nothing in itself as i say that s only being rats  {
            }
it s saving our knowledge and adding  {
     }
to it is the thing there men like you come in there s books there s models we must make great safe places down deep and get all the books we can not novels  {
                                }
and poetry  {
 }
swipes  {
 }
but ideas science books that s where men like you come in we must go to the british  {
	           births :: 9
                }
museum  {
 }
and pick all those books through especially we must keep up our science learn more we must watch these martians some of us must go as spies  {
                         }
when it s all working perhaps i will get caught i mean and the great thing is we must leave the martians alone we mustn  {
                       }
t even steal  {
 }
if we get in their way we clear out we must show them we mean no harm  {
               }
yes i know but they re intelligent things and they won t hunt us down if they have all they want and think we re just harmless  {
                         }
vermin  {

the artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon my arm after all it may not be so much we may have to learn before just imagine this four or five of their fighting machines suddenly starting off heat rays right and left and not a martian in em not a martian in em but men men who have learned the way how it may be in my time even those men fancy having one of them lovely  {
                                                                            }
things with its heat ray wide and free fancy having it in control what would it matter if you smashed to smithereens  {

                    }
at the end of the run after a bust like that i reckon the martians ll open their beautiful eyes can t you see them man can t you see them hurrying hurrying puffing  {
                                }
and blowing  {
 }
and hooting to their other mechanical affairs something out of gear in every case and swish bang rattle swish just as they are fumbling over it swish comes the heat ray and behold man has come back to his own for a while the imaginative  {
                                           }
daring of the artilleryman and the tone of assurance and courage he assumed completely dominated  {
             }
my mind i believed unhesitatingly  {
   }
both in his forecast of human destiny  {
     }
and in the practicability  {
  }
of his astonishing scheme and the reader who thinks me susceptible  {
         }
and foolish must contrast his position reading steadily with all his thoughts about his subject  {
             }
and mine crouching fearfully  {
  }
in the bushes and listening distracted by apprehension  {
      }
we talked in this manner through the early morning time and later crept out of the bushes and after scanning  {
                  }
the sky for martians hurried precipitately  {
	prelatical :: 12
    }
to the house on putney hill where he had made his lair  {
          }
it was the coal cellar of the place and when i saw the work he had spent a week upon it was a burrow scarcely ten yards long which he designed  {
                             }
to reach to the main drain on putney hill i had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his powers such a hole i could have dug  {
                            }
in a day but i believed in him sufficiently to work with him all that morning until past midday at his digging we had a garden barrow and shot the earth we removed against the kitchen range we refreshed ourselves with a tin of mock  {
                                           }
turtle  {
 }
soup and wine from the neighbouring pantry i found a curious relief  {
          }
from the aching strangeness of the world in this steady labour as we worked i turned his project over in my mind and presently objections  {
                       }
and doubts began to arise but i worked there all the morning so glad was i to find myself with a purpose again after working an hour i began to speculate  {
                             }
on the distance one had to go before the cloaca  {
        }
was reached the chances we had of missing it altogether my immediate trouble was why we should dig this long tunnel when it was possible to get into the drain at once down one of the manholes  {
                                   }
and work back to the house it seemed to me too that the house was inconveniently  {
              }
chosen  {
 }
and required a needless length of tunnel and just as i was beginning to face these things the artilleryman stopped digging and looked at me we re working well he said he put down his spade let us knock off a bit he said i think it s time we reconnoitred  {

from the roof of the house i was for going on and after a little hesitation he resumed his spade and then suddenly i was struck by a thought i stopped and so did he at once why were you walking about the common i said instead of being here taking the air he said i was coming back it s safer  {
                                                            }
by night but the work oh one can t always work he said and in a flash i saw the man plain he hesitated holding his spade we ought to reconnoitre now he said because if any come near they may hear the spades and drop upon us unawares  {
                                               }
i was no longer disposed to object we went together to the roof and stood on a ladder  {
                }
peeping out of the roof door no martians were to be seen and we ventured out on the tiles and slipped  {
                   }
down under shelter of the parapet from this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of putney but we could see the river below a bubbly  {
                        }
mass of red weed and the low parts of lambeth flooded and red the red creeper swarmed up the trees about the old palace  {
                      }
and their branches stretched gaunt and dead and set with shrivelled leaves from amid its clusters  {
              }
it was strange how entirely dependent  {
    }
both these things were upon flowing water for their propagation  {
        }
about us neither had gained a footing laburnums  {
      }
pink mays  {
 }
snowballs  {
 }
and trees of arbor  {
  }
vitae  {
 }
rose out of laurels  {
  }
and hydrangeas  {
 }
green and brilliant into the sunlight beyond kensington  {
      }
dense smoke was rising and that and a blue haze  {
        }
hid the northward hills the artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people who still remained in london one night last week he said some fools  {
                          }
got the electric light in order and there was all regent street and the circus  {
             }
ablaze  {
 }
crowded with painted  {
 }
and ragged  {
 }
drunkards men and women dancing  {
   }
and shouting till dawn a man who was there told me and as the day came they became aware of a fighting machine standing near by the langham  {
                          }
and looking down at them heaven knows how long he had been there it must have given some of them a nasty turn he came down the road towards them and picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened to run away grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe from that in answer to my questions he came round to his grandiose  {
                                                                 }
plans again he grew enthusiastic he talked so eloquently  {
       }
of the possibility of capturing  {
   }
a fighting machine that i more than half believed in him again but now that i was beginning to understand something of his quality i could divine  {
                         }
the stress he laid on doing nothing precipitately and i noted that now there was no question that he personally  {
                  }
was to capture and fight the great machine after a time we went down to the cellar neither of us seemed disposed to resume digging and when he suggested a meal i was nothing loath he became suddenly very generous and when we had eaten he went away and returned with some excellent  {
                                                   }
cigars  {
 }
we lit these and his optimism  {
    }
glowed he was inclined to regard my coming as a great occasion there s some champagne  {
              }
in the cellar he said we can dig better on this thames side burgundy said i no said he i am host today  {
                     }
champagne great god we ve a heavy enough task before us let us take a rest and gather strength while we may look at these blistered  {
                        }
hands and pursuant  {
 }
to this idea of a holiday  {
    }
he insisted upon playing cards  {
   }
after we had eaten he taught me euchre  {
      }
and after dividing  {
 }
london between us i taking the northern side and he the southern  {
          }
we played for parish  {
  }
points grotesque and foolish as this will seem to the sober reader it is absolutely true and what is more remarkable i found the card game and several others we played extremely interesting  {
                               }
strange mind of man that with our species upon the edge of extermination or appalling  {
             }
degradation  {
 }
with no clear prospect before us but the chance of a horrible death we could sit following the chance of this painted pasteboard  {
                     }
and playing the joker  {
  }
with vivid delight afterwards he taught me poker  {
      }
and i beat him at three tough  {
     }
chess  {
 }
games  {
 }
when dark came we decided to take the risk and lit a lamp after an interminable string of games we supped  {
                   }
and the artilleryman finished the champagne we went on smoking the cigars he was no longer the energetic regenerator  {
                 }
of his species i had encountered in the morning he was still optimistic but it was a less kinetic  {
                 }
a more thoughtful  {
 }
optimism i remember he wound up with my health proposed in a speech of small variety  {

across the london valley the northern hills were shrouded  {
       }
in darkness the fires near kensington glowed redly  {
      }
and now and then an orange  {
    }
red tongue of flame flashed up and vanished in the deep blue night all the rest of london was black then nearer i perceived a strange light a pale violet purple fluorescent  {
                              }
glow quivering under the night breeze  {
    }
for a space i could not understand it and then i knew that it must be the red weed from which this faint irradiation  {
	               ordinant :: 9
	            orientation :: 9
                      }
proceeded with that realisation my dormant  {
    }
sense of wonder my sense of the proportion of things awoke  {
         }
again i glanced from that to mars red and clear glowing high in the west and then gazed  {
                }
long and earnestly  {
 }
at the darkness of hampstead and highgate i remained a very long time upon the roof wondering at the grotesque changes of the day i recalled my mental states from the midnight prayer to the foolish card playing i had a violent revulsion  {
                                         }
of feeling i remember i flung away the cigar with a certain wasteful  {
           }
symbolism  {
 }
my folly came to me with glaring exaggeration  {
      }
i seemed a traitor  {
  }
to my wife and to my kind i was filled with remorse i resolved to leave this strange undisciplined  {
                 }
dreamer  {
 }
of great things to his drink and gluttony  {
      }
and to go on into london there it seemed to me i had the best chance of learning what the martians and my fellowmen  {
                      }
were doing i was still upon the roof when the late moon rose chapter eight dead london after i had parted from the artilleryman i went down the hill and by the high street across the bridge to fulham  {
                                     }
the red weed was tumultuous at that time and nearly choked the bridge roadway but its fronds were already whitened  {
                  }
in patches by the spreading disease that presently removed it so swiftly at the corner of the lane that runs to putney bridge station i found a man lying he was as black as a sweep with the black dust alive but helplessly and speechlessly  {

drunk i could get nothing from him but curses and furious lunges  {
          }
at my head i think i should have stayed by him but for the brutal expression of his face there was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards  {
                            }
and it grew thicker  {
  }
in fulham the streets were horribly quiet i got food sour hard and mouldy but quite eatable in a baker  {
                  }
s shop here some way towards walham  {
     }
green the streets became clear of powder and i passed a white terrace of houses on fire the noise of the burning was an absolute relief going on towards brompton  {
                            }
the streets were quiet again here i came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon dead bodies i saw altogether about a dozen  {
                         }
in the length of the fulham road they had been dead many days so that i hurried quickly past them the black powder covered them over and softened their outlines  {
                            }
one or two had been disturbed by dogs where there was no black powder it was curiously like a sunday in the city with the closed shops the houses locked up and the blinds drawn the desertion and the stillness in some places plunderers had been at work but rarely  {
                                                }
at other than the provision and wine shops a jeweller  {
        }
s window had been broken open in one place but apparently the thief  {
           }
had been disturbed and a number of gold chains  {
       }
and a watch lay scattered on the pavement i did not trouble to touch them farther on was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep  {
                         }
the hand that hung over her knee was gashed  {
       }
and bled  {
 }
down her rusty brown dress and a smashed magnum  {
       }
of champagne formed a pool across the pavement she seemed asleep but she was dead the farther i penetrated  {
                 }
into london the profounder grew the stillness but it was not so much the stillness of death it was the stillness of suspense of expectation at any time the destruction that had already singed  {

and derelict in south kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black powder it was near south kensington that i first heard the howling it crept almost imperceptibly  {
                            }
upon my senses  {
 }
it was a sobbing  {
  }
alternation  {
 }
of two notes ulla  {
	ulnar :: 4
	ulnae :: 4
	ulva :: 5
	ulna :: 5
	aula :: 4
	 ul :: 4
  }
ulla ulla ulla keeping on perpetually when i passed streets that ran northward it grew in volume and houses and buildings seemed to deaden and cut it off again it came in a full tide  {
                                 }
down exhibition  {
 }
road i stopped staring towards kensington gardens wondering at this strange remote wailing  {
           }
it was as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude  {
                }
ulla ulla ulla ulla wailed  {
   }
that superhuman  {
 }
note great waves of sound sweeping down the broad sunlit  {
        }
roadway between the tall buildings on each side i turned northwards  {
         }
marvelling  {
 }
towards the iron gates of hyde  {
    }
park i had half a mind to break into the natural history museum and find my way up to the summits  {
                   }
of the towers in order to see across the park but i decided to keep to the ground where quick hiding was possible and so went on up the exhibition road all the large mansions  {
                                 }
on each side of the road were empty and still and my footsteps echoed  {
            }
against the sides of the houses at the top near the park gate i came upon a strange sight a bus overturned and the skeleton of a horse picked clean i puzzled  {
                              }
over this for a time and then went on to the bridge over the serpentine  {
             }
the voice grew stronger and stronger though i could see nothing above the housetops on the north side of the park save a haze  {
                      }
of smoke to the northwest ulla ulla ulla ulla cried the voice coming as it seemed to me from the district about regent s park the desolating cry worked upon my mind the mood that had sustained me passed the wailing took possession of me i found i was intensely weary footsore and now again hungry and thirsty it was already past noon  {
                                                             }
why was i wandering alone in this city of the dead why was i alone when all london was lying in state and in its black shroud i felt intolerably  {
                            }
lonely  {
 }
my mind ran on old friends that i had forgotten  {
        }
for years i thought of the poisons  {
     }
in the chemists  {
 }
shops of the liquors  {
  }
the wine merchants  {
 }
stored  {
 }
i recalled the two sodden creatures of despair who so far as i knew shared the city with myself i came into oxford street by the marble arch and here again were black powder and several bodies and an evil ominous smell from the gratings  {
                                           }
of the cellars of some of the houses i grew very thirsty after the heat of my long walk with infinite trouble i managed to break into a public house and get food and drink i was weary after eating and went into the parlour  {
                                           }
behind the bar and slept on a black horsehair  {
       }
sofa  {
 }
i found there i awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears ulla ulla ulla ulla it was now dusk and after i had routed  {
                         }
out some biscuits and a cheese in the bar there was a meat safe but it contained nothing but maggots  {
                  }
i wandered on through the silent residential  {
     }
squares to baker street portman square is the only one i can name and so came out at last upon regent s park and as i emerged from the top of baker street i saw far away over the trees in the clearness of the sunset the hood of the martian giant from which this howling proceeded i was not terrified i came upon him as if it were a matter of course i watched him for some time but he did not move he appeared to be standing and yelling for no reason that i could discover i tried to formulate a plan of action that perpetual sound of ulla ulla ulla ulla confused my mind perhaps i was too tired to be very fearful certainly i was more curious to know the reason of this monotonous  {
                                                                                                                                        }
crying than afraid i turned back away from the park and struck into park road intending  {
              }
to skirt the park went along under the shelter of the terraces and got a view of this stationary howling martian from the direction of st john s wood a couple of hundred yards out of baker street i heard a yelping chorus and saw first a dog with a piece of putrescent  {
                                                   }
red meat in his jaws  {
   }
coming headlong towards me and then a pack of starving mongrels  {
         }
in pursuit  {
 }
of him he made a wide curve to avoid me as though he feared i might prove a fresh competitor as the yelping died away down the silent road the wailing sound of ulla ulla ulla ulla reasserted  {
                                    }
itself i came upon the wrecked handling machine halfway to st john s wood station at first i thought a house had fallen across the road it was only as i clambered among the ruins that i saw with a start this mechanical samson  {
	                                     damson :: 8
	                                     ramson :: 8

                                          }
lying with its tentacles bent and smashed and twisted among the ruins it had made the forepart  {
               }
was shattered it seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house and had been overwhelmed  {
	        overwhelm :: 15
                }
in its overthrow it seemed to me then that this might have happened by a handling machine escaping from the guidance of its martian i could not clamber among the ruins to see it and the twilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seat was smeared and the gnawed gristle  {
                                                     }
of the martian that the dogs had left were invisible to me wondering still more at all that i had seen i pushed on towards primrose hill far away through a gap in the trees i saw a second martian as motionless as the first standing in the park towards the zoological  {
                                                  }
gardens and silent a little beyond the ruins about the smashed handling machine i came upon the red weed again and found the regent s canal a spongy  {
                          }
mass of dark red vegetation as i crossed the bridge the sound of ulla ulla ulla ulla ceased it was as it were cut off the silence came like a thunderclap the dusky  {
                               }
houses about me stood faint and tall and dim the trees towards the park were growing black all about me the red weed clambered among the ruins writhing to get above me in the dimness  {
                                 }
night the mother of fear and mystery was coming upon me but while that voice sounded the solitude the desolation had been endurable by virtue  {
                       }
of it london had still seemed alive and the sense of life about me had upheld me then suddenly a change the passing of something i knew not what and then a stillness that could be felt nothing but this gaunt quiet london about me gazed  {
                                            }
at me spectrally  {
 }
the windows in the white houses were like the eye sockets of skulls  {
           }
about me my imagination found a thousand noiseless enemies  {
       }
moving terror seized  {
 }
me a horror of my temerity  {
    }
in front of me the road became pitchy  {
      }
black as though it was tarred  {
    }
and i saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway  {
        }
i could not bring myself to go on i turned down st john s wood road and ran headlong from this unendurable  {
                    }
stillness towards kilburn i hid from the night and the silence until long after midnight in a cabmen s shelter in harrow  {
                    }
road but before the dawn my courage returned and while the stars were still in the sky i turned once more towards regent s park i missed my way among the streets and presently saw down a long avenue in the half light of the early dawn the curve of primrose hill on the summit towering up to the fading stars was a third martian erect and motionless like the others an insane resolve possessed me i would die and end it and i would save myself even the trouble of killing myself i marched on recklessly  {
                                                                                               }
towards this titan and then as i drew nearer and the light grew i saw that a multitude of black birds was circling  {
                     }
and clustering  {
 }
about the hood at that my heart gave a bound  {
        }
and i began running along the road i hurried through the red weed that choked st edmund  {
               }
s terrace i waded breast high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from the waterworks  {
                }
towards the albert  {
 }
road and emerged upon the grass before the rising of the sun great mounds  {
            }
had been heaped about the crest of the hill making a huge redoubt  {
           }
of it it was the final and largest  {
      }
place the martians had made and from behind these heaps there rose a thin smoke against the sky against the sky line an eager dog ran and disappeared the thought that had flashed into my mind grew real grew credible i felt no fear only a wild trembling  {
                                              }
exultation as i ran up the hill towards the motionless monster out of the hood hung lank shreds  {
                }
of brown at which the hungry birds pecked  {
      }
and tore  {
 }
in another moment i had scrambled up the earthen  {
       }
rampart and stood upon its crest and the interior of the redoubt was below me a mighty space it was with gigantic machines here and there within it huge mounds of material and strange shelter places and scattered about it some in their overturned war machines some in the now rigid handling machines and a dozen  {
                                                      }
of them stark  {
 }
and silent and laid in a row were the martians dead slain by the putrefactive  {
             }
and disease bacteria against which their systems were unprepared  {
       }
slain as the red weed was being slain slain after all man s devices had failed by the humblest  {
                 }
things that god in his wisdom  {
    }
has put upon this earth for so it had come about as indeed i and many men might have foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds these germs  {
                            }
of disease have taken toll  {
   }
of humanity since the beginning of things taken toll of our prehuman  {
          }
ancestors  {
 }
since life began here but by virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power to no germs do we succumb without a struggle and to many those that cause putrefaction  {
                                 }
in dead matter for instance our living frames are altogether immune  {
         }
but there are no bacteria in mars and directly these invaders arrived directly they drank and fed  {

allies  {
 }
began to work their overthrow already when i watched them they were irrevocably  {
           }
doomed  {
 }
dying and rotting  {
 }
even as they went to and fro it was inevitable by the toll of a billion  {
              }
deaths  {
 }
man has bought his birthright  {
   }
of the earth and it is his against all comers it would still be his were the martians ten times as mighty as they are for neither do men live nor die in vain here and there they were scattered nearly fifty altogether in that great gulf they had made overtaken by a death that must have seemed to them as incomprehensible as any death could be to me also at that time this death was incomprehensible all i knew was that these things that had been alive and so terrible to men were dead for a moment i believed that the destruction of sennacherib  {
                                                                                                       }
had been repeated that god had repented  {
     }
that the angel  {
 }
of death had slain them in the night i stood staring into the pit and my heart lightened  {
                }
gloriously  {
 }
even as the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with his rays the pit was still in darkness the mighty engines so great and wonderful in their power and complexity  {
                               }
so unearthly in their tortuous  {
   }
forms rose weird and vague and strange out of the shadows towards the light a multitude of dogs i could hear fought over the bodies that lay darkly in the depth  {
                             }
of the pit far below me across the pit on its farther lip flat and vast and strange lay the great flying machine with which they had been experimenting  {
	                  experiment :: 15
	                experimental :: 13
                           }
upon our denser atmosphere when decay  {
    }
and death arrested them death had come not a day too soon at the sound of a cawing  {
                }
overhead i looked up at the huge fighting machine that would fight no more for ever at the tattered red shreds of flesh that dripped  {
                       }
down upon the overturned seats on the summit of primrose hill i turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where enhaloed  {
                      }
now in birds stood those other two martians that i had seen overnight just as death had overtaken them the one had died even as it had been crying to its companions perhaps it was the last to die and its voice had gone on perpetually until the force of its machinery was exhausted they glittered now harmless tripod towers of shining metal in the brightness of the rising sun all about the pit and saved as by a miracle from everlasting  {
                                                                                }
destruction stretched the great mother of cities those who have only seen london veiled in her sombre robes  {
                }
of smoke can scarcely imagine the naked clearness and beauty  {
        }
of the silent wilderness  {
  }
of houses eastward over the blackened ruins of the albert terrace and the splintered  {
            }
spire of the church the sun blazed  {
     }
dazzling  {
 }
in a clear sky and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs caught the light and glared  {
                   }
with a white intensity northward were kilburn and hampsted  {
       }
blue and crowded with houses westward the great city was dimmed  {
         }
and southward beyond the martians the green waves of regent s park the langham hotel  {
             }
the dome of the albert hall the imperial  {
      }
institute  {
 }
and the giant mansions of the brompton road came out clear and little in the sunrise  {
              }
the jagged  {
 }
ruins of westminster rising hazily  {
   }
beyond far away and blue were the surrey hills and the towers of the crystal  {
             }
palace glittered like two silver rods the dome of st paul  {
         }
s was dark against the sunrise and injured  {
      }
i saw for the first time by a huge gaping  {
        }
cavity on its western side and as i looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories  {
               }
and churches silent and abandoned as i thought of the multitudinous hopes  {
          }
and efforts the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to build this human reef  {
             }
and of the swift and ruthless destruction that had hung over it all when i realised that the shadow had been rolled back and that men might still live in the streets and this dear vast dead city of mine be once more alive and powerful i felt a wave of emotion that was near akin  {
                                                      }
to tears the torment  {
  }
was over even that day the healing  {
     }
would begin the survivors of the people scattered over the country leaderless  {
          }
lawless  {
 }
foodless  {
 }
like sheep without a shepherd  {
   }
the thousands who had fled by sea would begin to return the pulse  {
           }
of life growing stronger and stronger would beat again in the empty streets and pour across the vacant squares whatever destruction was done the hand of the destroyer was stayed all the gaunt wrecks  {
                                }
the blackened skeletons of houses that stared so dismally  {
       }
at the sunlit grass of the hill would presently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers  {
               }
and ringing with the tapping of their trowels  {
      }
at the thought i extended my hands towards the sky and began thanking  {
           }
god in a year thought i in a year with overwhelming  {
         }
force came the thought of myself of my wife and the old life of hope and tender  {
               }
helpfulness  {
	helpful :: 11
 }
that had ceased for ever chapter nine wreckage and now comes the strangest thing in my story yet perhaps it is not altogether strange i remember clearly and coldly  {
                           }
and vividly all that i did that day until the time that i stood weeping and praising  {
               }
god upon the summit of primrose hill and then i forget of the next three days i know nothing i have learned since that so far from my being the first discoverer  {
                              }
of the martian overthrow several such wanderers  {
     }
as myself had already discovered this on the previous night one man the first had gone to st martin  {
                 }
s le grand and while i sheltered in the cabmen s hut had contrived to telegraph to paris thence the joyful  {
                   }
news had flashed all over the world a thousand cities chilled  {
         }
by ghastly  {
 }
apprehensions  {
 }
suddenly flashed into frantic illuminations  {

   }
they knew of it in dublin  {
	unblind :: 10
	dunlin :: 10
    }
edinburgh  {
 }
manchester  {
 }
birmingham at the time when i stood upon the verge of the pit already men weeping with joy as i have heard shouting and staying their work to shake  {
                           }
hands and shout were making up trains even as near as crewe  {
          }
to descend upon london the church bells that had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news until all england was bell ringing men on cycles lean faced unkempt scorched along every country lane shouting of unhoped  {
                                   }
deliverance  {
 }
shouting to gaunt staring figures of despair and for the food across the channel across the irish  {

sea across the atlantic  {

  }
corn bread and meat were tearing to our relief all the shipping in the world seemed going londonward in those days but of all this i have no memory i drifted a demented man i found myself in a house of kindly  {
                                        }
people who had found me on the third day wandering weeping and raving  {
           }
through the streets of st john s wood they have told me since that i was singing some insane doggerel  {
                  }
about the last man left alive hurrah  {
     }
the last man left alive troubled as they were with their own affairs these people whose name much as i would like to express my gratitude  {
                        }
to them i may not even give here nevertheless  {
       }
cumbered  {
 }
themselves with me sheltered me and protected  {
     }
me from myself apparently they had learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse  {
                 }
very gently when my mind was assured again did they break to me what they had learned of the fate of leatherhead two days after i was imprisoned  {
                          }
it had been destroyed with every soul in it by a martian he had swept it out of existence as it seemed without any provocation  {
                       }
as a boy might crush an ant hill in the mere wantonness  {
          }
of power i was a lonely man and they were very kind to me i was a lonely man and a sad one and they bore with me i remained with them four days after my recovery  {
                                   }
all that time i felt a vague a growing craving  {
        }
to look once more on whatever remained of the little life that seemed so happy and bright in my past it was a mere hopeless desire to feast  {
                          }
upon my misery  {
 }
they dissuaded me they did all they could to divert me from this morbidity  {
            }
but at last i could resist the impulse no longer and promising  {
          }
faithfully  {
 }
to return to them and parting  {
    }
as i will confess from these four day friends with tears i went out again into the streets that had lately  {
                   }
been so dark and strange and empty already they were busy with returning people in places even there were shops open and i saw a drinking fountain running water i remember how mockingly  {
                               }
bright the day seemed as i went back on my melancholy pilgrimage  {
          }
to the little house at woking how busy the streets and vivid the moving life about me so many people were abroad  {
                    }
everywhere busied in a thousand activities  {
    }
that it seemed incredible that any great proportion of the population could have been slain but then i noticed how yellow were the skins of the people i met how shaggy  {
                             }
the hair of the men how large and bright their eyes and that every other man still wore his dirty rags their faces seemed all with one of two expressions a leaping exultation and energy or a grim resolution save for the expression of the faces london seemed a city of tramps the vestries  {
                                                    }
were indiscriminately  {
 }
distributing  {
 }
bread sent us by the french government the ribs  {
       }
of the few horses showed dismally haggard special constables  {
       }
with white badges  {
 }
stood at the corners of every street i saw little of the mischief  {
           }
wrought by the martians until i reached wellington street and there i saw the red weed clambering over the buttresses  {
                  }
of waterloo bridge at the corner of the bridge too i saw one of the common contrasts  {
               }
of that grotesque time a sheet of paper flaunting  {
       }
against a thicket of the red weed transfixed  {
      }
by a stick that kept it in place it was the placard of the first newspaper to resume publication the daily mail i bought a copy for a blackened shilling i found in my pocket most of it was in blank but the solitary compositor  {
                                           }
who did the thing had amused  {
    }
himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement  {
      }
stereo on the back page  {
   }
the matter he printed was emotional the news organisation had not as yet found its way back i learned nothing fresh except that already in one week the examination of the martian mechanisms had yielded  {
                                 }
astonishing results  {
 }
among other things the article assured me what i did not believe at the time that the secret  {
                }
of flying was discovered at waterloo i found the free trains that were taking people to their homes  {
                }
the first rush was already over there were few people in the train and i was in no mood for casual  {
                   }
conversation i got a compartment  {
	compart :: 14
	comparted :: 14
   }
to myself and sat with folded  {
    }
arms looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows and just outside the terminus the train jolted  {
                  }
over temporary rails and on either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins to clapham junction the face of london was grimy  {
                      }
with powder of the black smoke in spite of two days of thunderstorms  {
	    thunders :: 16
	  thunderous :: 15
           }
and rain and at clapham junction the line had been wrecked again there were hundreds of out of work clerks and shopmen working side by side with the customary  {
                           }
navvies and we were jolted over a hasty relaying  {
       }
all down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt and unfamiliar wimbledon particularly had suffered walton by virtue of its unburned  {
                       }
pine woods seemed the least hurt of any place along the line the wandle  {
            }
the mole every little stream was a heaped mass of red weed in appearance between butcher s meat and pickled  {
                  }
cabbage  {
 }
the surrey pine woods were too dry however for the festoons  {
         }
of the red climber  {
  }
beyond wimbledon within sight of the line in certain nursery  {
        }
grounds were the heaped masses of earth about the sixth cylinder a number of people were standing about it and some sappers were busy in the midst of it over it flaunted a union  {
                                }
jack flapping cheerfully  {
 }
in the morning breeze  {
  }
the nursery grounds were everywhere crimson with the weed a wide expanse of livid  {
            }
colour cut with purple shadows and very painful to the eye one s gaze  {
            }
went with infinite relief from the scorched greys  {
      }
and sullen  {
 }
reds  {
 }
of the foreground  {
 }
to the blue green softness  {
   }
of the eastward hills the line on the london side of woking station was still undergoing  {
              }
repair so i descended at byfleet station and took the road to maybury past the place where i and the artilleryman had talked to the hussars and on by the spot where the martian had appeared to me in the thunderstorm here moved by curiosity i turned aside to find among a tangle of red fronds the warped  {
                                                        }
and broken dog cart with the whitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed for a time i stood regarding these vestiges then i returned through the pine wood neck high with red weed here and there to find the landlord of the spotted dog had already found burial  {
                                               }
and so came home past the college arms a man standing at an open cottage door greeted  {
               }
me by name as i passed i looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded immediately the door had been forced it was unfast and was opening slowly as i approached it slammed  {
                                   }
again the curtains  {
 }
of my study fluttered  {
  }
out of the open window from which i and the artilleryman had watched the dawn no one had closed it since the smashed bushes were just as i had left them nearly four weeks  {
                                }
ago i stumbled into the hall and the house felt empty the stair carpet was ruffled  {
              }
and discoloured  {
	discolour :: 15
	discolours :: 14
 }
where i had crouched soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the catastrophe our muddy footsteps i saw still went up the stairs i followed them to my study and found lying on my writing table still with the selenite  {
                                         }
paper weight upon it the sheet of work i had left on the afternoon of the opening of the cylinder for a space i stood reading over my abandoned arguments  {
                            }
it was a paper on the probable development of moral ideas with the development of the civilising  {
               }
process and the last sentence was the opening of a prophecy in about two hundred years i had written we may expect the sentence ended abruptly i remembered my inability  {
                            }
to fix my mind that morning scarcely a month  {
       }
gone by and how i had broken off to get my daily chronicle from the newsboy  {
              }
i remembered how i went down to the garden gate as he came along and how i had listened to his odd story of men from mars i came down and went into the dining room there were the mutton and the bread both far gone now in decay and a beer bottle overturned just as i and the artilleryman had left them my home was desolate i perceived the folly of the faint hope i had cherished  {
                                                                            }
so long and then a strange thing occurred it is no use said a voice the house is deserted no one has been here these ten days do not stay here to torment yourself no one escaped but you i was startled had i spoken my thought aloud i turned and the french window was open behind me i made a step to it and stood looking out and there amazed  {
                                                                     }
and afraid even as i stood amazed  {
     }
and afraid were my cousin and my wife my wife white and tearless  {
           }
she gave a faint cry i came she said i knew knew she put her hand to her throat swayed i made a step forward and caught her in my arms chapter ten the epilogue  {
                                 }
i cannot but regret now that i am concluding  {
       }
my story how little i am able to contribute  {
       }
to the discussion of the many debatable  {
     }
questions which are still unsettled  {
   }
in one respect i shall certainly provoke  {
     }
criticism  {
 }
my particular province is speculative philosophy  {
    }
my knowledge of comparative  {
  }
physiology is confined to a book or two but it seems to me that carver  {
             }
s suggestions as to the reason of the rapid death of the martians is so probable as to be regarded almost as a proven  {
                      }
conclusion  {
 }
i have assumed that in the body of my narrative at any rate in all the bodies of the martians that were examined  {
                     }
after the war no bacteria except those already known as terrestrial species were found that they did not bury  {
                 }
any of their dead and the reckless slaughter  {
      }
they perpetrated  {

 }
point also to an entire ignorance of the putrefactive process but probable as this seems it is by no means a proven conclusion neither is the composition of the black smoke known which the martians used with such deadly effect and the generator of the heat rays remains a puzzle  {
                                                }

analysts  {

for further investigations upon the latter spectrum analysis  {
      }
of the black powder points unmistakably  {
    }
to the presence of an unknown element with a brilliant group of three lines in the green and it is possible that it combines  {
                      }
with argon to form a compound  {
    }
which acts  {
 }
at once with deadly effect upon some constituent  {
	constitutes :: 13
      }
in the blood but such unproven  {
    }
speculations  {
 }
will scarcely be of interest to the general reader to whom this story is addressed none of the brown scum that drifted down the thames after the destruction of shepperton was examined at the time and now none is forthcoming  {
                                      }
the results of an anatomical examination of the martians so far as the prowling  {
            }
dogs had left such an examination possible i have already given but everyone is familiar with the magnificent  {
                }
and almost complete specimen  {
  }
in spirits at the natural history museum and the countless drawings  {
         }
that have been made from it and beyond that the interest of their physiology and structure is purely  {
                }
scientific a question of graver  {
   }
and universal interest is the possibility of another attack from the martians i do not think that nearly enough attention is being given to this aspect of the matter at present the planet mars is in conjunction  {
                                   }
but with every return to opposition i for one anticipate a renewal  {
          }
of their adventure in any case we should be prepared it seems to me that it should be possible to define  {
                   }
the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged to keep a sustained watch upon this part of the planet and to anticipate the arrival of the next attack in that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or artillery before it was sufficiently cool for the martians to emerge or they might be butchered  {
                                                        }
by means of guns so soon as the screw opened it seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the failure  {
                      }
of their first surprise possibly they see it in the same light lessing  {

has advanced excellent reasons  {
  }
for supposing  {
 }
that the martians have actually succeeded in effecting  {
      }
a landing on the planet venus  {
    }
seven months  {
 }
ago now venus and mars were in alignment  {
      }
with the sun that is to say mars was in opposition from the point of view of an observer on venus subsequently  {
                    }
a peculiar luminous and sinuous  {
   }
marking appeared on the unillumined  {

   }
half of the inner  {
  }
planet and almost simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character was detected  {
             }
upon a photograph of the martian disk one needs to see the drawings of these appearances in order to appreciate  {
                  }
fully their remarkable resemblance in character at any rate whether we expect another invasion or not our views  {
                }
of the human future  {
  }
must be greatly modified  {
  }
by these events we have learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced  {
              }
in and a secure abiding  {
   }
place for man we can never anticipate the unseen good or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space it may be that in the larger design of the universe this invasion from mars is not without its ultimate benefit  {
                                        }
for men it has robbed us of that serene confidence in the future which is the most fruitful  {
                }
source of decadence  {
 }
the gifts  {
 }
to human science it has brought are enormous and it has done much to promote  {
             }
the conception of the commonweal  {
   }
of mankind it may be that across the immensity of space the martians have watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson and that on the planet venus they have found a securer  {
                                   }
settlement  {
 }
be that as it may for many years yet there will certainly be no relaxation  {
             }
of the eager scrutiny of the martian disk and those fiery darts  {
          }
of the sky the shooting stars will bring with them as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons  {
                  }
of men the broadening of men s views that has resulted  {
         }
can scarcely be exaggerated  {
	exaggerate :: 9
  }
before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty surface of our minute sphere  {
                         }
now we see further if the martians can reach venus there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible for men and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth uninhabitable  {
                                 }
as at last it must do it may be that the thread of life that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planet within its toils  {
                            }
dim and wonderful is the vision i have conjured  {
       }
up in my mind of life spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar  {
              }
system throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal  {
     }
space but that is a remote dream it may be on the other hand that the destruction of the martians is only a reprieve  {
                      }
to them and not to us perhaps is the future ordained  {
         }
i must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding sense of doubt and insecurity  {
                 }
in my mind i sit in my study writing by lamplight  {
         }
and suddenly i see again the healing valley below set with writhing flames and feel the house behind and about me empty and desolate i go out into the byfleet road and vehicles pass me a butcher boy in a cart a cabful  {
                                         }
of visitors a workman on a bicycle children going to school and suddenly they become vague and unreal  {
                }
and i hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot brooding  {
         }
silence of a night i see the black powder darkening  {
        }
the silent streets and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer  {
         }
they rise upon me tattered and dog bitten  {
      }
they gibber  {
 }
and grow fiercer  {
 }
paler  {
 }
uglier  {
 }
