#Goal: Creating a spell checker and word suggestor that learns and will offer 
#the user a chance to add whichever words they want, to a dictionary of already recognized words. 
#For now the learnt words are added to 'learnt_words.txt'.

#To test current setup: 
#First run:	
#    make
#
# For an interactive session:
#  cd exec OR make spellCorrect && cd exec
#  ./spellCorrect 
#
#For testing out with a file:
#  cd exec OR make autoCorrect && cd exec
#  ./autoCorrect <sourcePath> <destinationOfLearntWords> > suggestions.txt
#
#To test out the multi-threaded autoCorrection:
#  cd exec OR make workSplitter && cd exec
#  ./workSplitter <sourcePath> <nThreads_or_Cores_available>
#Sample output file samples/warOWCorrected.txt and samples/warOWLearnt.txt included as the result
#of passing in 'waroftheworlds.txt' as the subject file.
