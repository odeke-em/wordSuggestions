#Goal: Creating a spell checker and word suggestor that learns and will offer 
#the user a chance to add whichever words they want, to a dictionary of already recognized words. 
#For now the learnt words are added to 'learnt_words.txt'.

#To test current setup: 
#First run:	make
#
# For an interactive session:
#  ./spellCorrect 
#
#For testing out with a file:
#  ./autoCorrect <sourcePath> <destinationOfLearntWords> > suggestions.txt
#
#Sample output file 'suggestions.txt' included as the result of passing in 
#'waroftheworlds.txt' as the subject file.
